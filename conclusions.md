# Conclusions

Karl Popper, one of the great minds of philosophy of science, once wrote:

> Bold ideas, unjustified anticipations, and speculative thought, are our only means for interpreting nature: our only organon, our only instrument, for grasping her.<!-- cite author="Karl Popper" title="The Logic of Scientific Discovery" date="1959" location="page 280" type="book" href="http://strangebeautiful.com/other-texts/popper-logic-scientific-discovery.pdf" -->

If methodology was restricted to the bare objective listing of artifacts of the Flower of Life, the conclusion would be much thinner. We would probably just say that we cannot know what was meant with the symbol, or we cannot be sure where and why it was made because it is not written and told on any ancient source. But would we *know* even if someone told? There is always verification and interpretation layers to walk through. Widening methodology of the research by applying hermeneutics and to contain subjective interpretations based on the understanding of the geometry of the FOL, tracing the etymology of words related to the symbol and examining mythology around the symbol we can conclude much more. If not bold and daring yet, however, I'm ready to make some conjectures that I wasn't ready two years ago.

The Flower of Life symbol in its class 1, 2, 3 and p forms was developed from religious floral motif analogous to the Tree of Life. But instead of presenting motif from the side view, the FOL represents the idea of the sacred flower (tree) from the top view. The FOL represents knowledge and order (logos, child) raising from a mixture of mythical water elements (salt & fresh sea parents, chaos, and cosmos). The FOL was later, at the dawn of the common era, a symbol of life and death in conjunction with a lily symbology. The FOL symbolizing primarily life and light is later developed by matured spiritual rebirth and religious reunion concepts. This is perhaps a way how the FOL symbol became a symbol for bridal gifts in Finland. The very meaning of *religio* or *yoga* (which both means to join) is often depicted with bride and bridegroom symbology. The modern meaning of the symbol is thus developed a) from perceiving order from chaos b) to a more mystical experience of knowing the mysteries of life and death c) finally to the experience of connection between "things". Yet it is easy to see, at least for a mystically oriented mind, that all these are just a depiction of the same process, no matter how many ways it is presented.

Outward movement, outrospection so to say, can bring out new inventions and discoveries that might or might not have been on minds of ancients when they launched the FOL symbol. Was the symbol itself an invention, or a discovery, the question is not making justice for the subject. Both discovery and invention are often involved on the process and development of new ideas. On the other hand, the FOL symbol, strictly speaking, does not occur anywhere in nature. So it must be an abstraction (=invention) of natural forms and laws, that were discovered by learned ancient people. And that abstraction-invention was not made by an accident but as a consequence of the long tradition of arithmetic and geometric practice.

On my research, I have taken a more objective look to the hard facts of the historical occurrences of the symbol and I have separated it from speculation of the meaning of the symbol. Nevertheless, I have taken both objective and subjective steps in a hope it will raise more discussion of the meaning, not just plain listing and descriptions of the FOL occurrences. Yet, practical applications are also a different topic, that should be discussed. If the Flower of Life symbology can be seen in the mesocosm, in a cultural exchange between humans in our sensory level, could the Flower of Life geometry be applicable on the microcosmic and macrocosmic levels too? What happens if the Flower of Life symbology is transferred from the two-dimensional plane geometry to the three-dimensional sphere and above? I think the real adventure starts somewhere from these fields of questions.
