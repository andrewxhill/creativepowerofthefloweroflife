# Appendix 1 - Classifications

There are several reasons why we need classifications in general. Categories helps to group and determine group specialties needed to find similarities and differences between objects. Classification will increase resolution of the problem field and explains relationships between objects. Among quantitative and qualitative research methods types of descriptive and categorization are very useful methods which all supplements each other. By classification we may further reason the local and temporal development of the motifs. Mathematical properties belonging to each group and progressing between groups may give extra insights to the historical development of the motif. Classification helps to discuss about the topic with more detailed and unambiguous terms.

I have distincted seven main classifications where the first two of them are preliminary appearances of the FOL (plain single circle excluded). Next three are main classes (1, 2 & 3). The sixth is reserved to indicate any progressive stage of the FOL greater than 3. The seventh is for pattern occurrences of the FOL separate from symbol appearances.

1. Vesica Piscis
2. Six petal rosette
3. Class 1
4. Class 2
5. Class 3
6. Class n (n > 3)
7. Class p (p = pattern)
