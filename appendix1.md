# Appendix 1 - Classifications

There are several reasons why we need classifications in general. Categories helps to group and determine group specialties needed to find similarities and differences between objects. Classification will increase resolution of the problem field and explains relationships between objects. Among quantitative and qualitative research methods types of descriptive and categorization are very useful methods which all supplements each other. By classification we may further reason the local and the temporal development of motives. Mathematical properties belonging to each group and progressing between groups may give extra insights to the historical development of the motif. Classification helps to discuss about the topic with more detailed and unambiguous terms.

I have distinguished seven main classifications where the first two of them are preliminary appearances of the FOL (a plain single circle excluded). Next three are main classes (1, 2, and 3). The sixth is reserved to indicate any progressive stage of the FOL greater than 3. Finally, the seventh is for pattern occurrences of the FOL separate from symbol appearances.

1. Vesica Piscis
2. Six petal rosette
3. Class 1
4. Class 2
5. Class 3
6. Class n (n > 3)
7. Class p (p = pattern)

The FOL formation could also have been categorized to two other groups: hexagonal and concave forms. Many of the occurrences of the symbol instead of using curved lines, uses straight lines which creates a hexagonal grid. But I have left this categorization for the future work.

## Vesica Piscis

![Vesica Piscis](/media/vesica-piscis.png){caption=1 width=200}

Two same size circles intersecting each other at the center of the circles. After a point, line and circular plane the most fundamental geometrical component of the Flower of Life symbol. Vesica Piscis is sometimes called mandorla, or almond, especially on the orthodox iconography.

Piscis or a fish <img src="./media/smallfish.png" width="30" /> is known to refer to the middle of the symbol which is somewhat similar to a fish shape. The ratio between the radius of the circle and straight line drawn on two intersection points is called the measure of a fish. The ratio is a square root of 3 or its reciprocal 1/√3 depending which one of the two lines is taken as a measurement of the unit. This geometric form is so famous and well known in history and has so much information available that it doesn’t really need any special description.

## Six-petal rosette

![Six-petal rosette a](/media/fol-class-0.png){caption=1}
![Six-petal rosette b](/media/fol-class-0-helper.png){caption=1}
<!-- clear -->

With or without the circle around, this is one of the most used geometric formation in the ancient art. Rosette is a general name for a symmetrical appearance of the flower-like petals. Petals can be three, four, five, six or any multiple of these. But in speaking of the FOL, the six-petal rosette is the correct one. The most important aspect of this symbol is the relation between 6 and 7, six leaves and 7 intersecting points. Occurrences of it are too common to be presented on the scope of this research document.


## Class 1

![FOL class 1 a](/media/fol-class-1.png){caption=1}
![FOL class 1 b](/media/fol-class-1-helper.png){caption=1}
<!-- clear -->

This is the simplest of the FOL symbols in categories and actually not as actively collected on my artifacts list as classes 2 and 3. Criteria for including this symbol on the FOL classifications is because symbol requires additional helper circles and arcs being drawn outside the final motif, which arcs are then erased from the final picture. This is a common factor for all classes 1, 2, and 3.

Usage of the class 1 FOL may bring an early relation to the lily flower because the lily was attached, like a common modern association, with the afterlife and the death. This connection is further supplemented with one of the oldest artifact related to the FOL collection, Mycenaean [golden rosettes](http://artifacts.flowerofliferesearch.com/2000-0bc.html#fig6.1.1) (1600 BC) from my previous research. These gold foil disks were buried with royal people as special "attachments"<!-- cite author="Irene S. Lemos" title="The Protogeometric Aegean: The Archaeology of the Late Eleventh and Tenth Centuries BC" date="2002" location="Page 130" type="book" href="https://books.google.fi/books?redir_esc=y&hl=fi&id=TIk9smxMvzAC&q=attachments#v=snippet&q=attachments&f=false" -->. [Golden goblet](http://artifacts.flowerofliferesearch.com/2000-0bc.html#fig6.1.4) (1400 - 1100 BC) from Marlik is one of the early class 1 FOL appearances. Goblets in Marlik were all found from the royal burial sites. The motif can also be seen on many Roman mosaics, funerary steles, and ossuaries.

Similarly, with the six-petal rosette, the class 1 FOL is too common to be collected on a small documentation project. Although my central focus is mainly to bring class 2 and 3 artifacts on daylight, cataloging early occurrences of the class 1 FOL artifacts surely helps to reveal crucial knowledge from the origin of the symbol.

In this complementary document [item 1](newitems.html#item-1), [item 2 a, b, c](newitems.html#item-2-a-b-c), and [item 5](newitems.html#item-5) as a continuous ornament contains the class 1 version of the FOL.

## Class 2

![FOL class 2 a](/media/fol-class-2.png){caption=1}
![FOL class 2 b](/media/fol-class-2-helper.png){caption=1}
<!-- clear -->

The next stage of the FOL symbol is the class 2. The earliest occurrence of this version can be found from the Egyptian [cosmetic box](http://artifacts.flowerofliferesearch.com/2000-0bc.html#fig6.1.2) (1500 BC). Other cosmetic boxes from Egypt at the same date contains also 24 petalled rosettes made with a compass and were all possibly used to store lotus fragrances. Ivory whorls from Cyprus, which contains the FOL class 2, are dated roughly to the same period, middle of the second millennium. Silver goblet from Marlik in 1000 BC contains it as well as the bowl from Levant, 800 BC. Many roman period mosaics uses this formation and numerous woodwork at the Common Era. [Items 2 b and c](newitems.html#item-2-a-b-c), [item 3](newitems.html#item-3), [item 4](newitems.html#item-4), [item 6](newitems.html#item-6), and [item 7](newitems.html#item-7) in this complementary document have this symbol attached on them. 

From the samples we have, it is clear that this form is already more difficult to draw than the class 1. A slight miss-position with the compass will accrue and soon the miss-orientation becomes visible for the eye. D. Melchizedek calls this form a "seed of life"<!-- cite author="Drunvalo Melchizedek" title="The ancient Secret of the Flower of Life, vol 1" date="1999" location="Figure 2-21" type="book" href="" -->, but doesn’t give any special name for the FOL class 1.

There are totally 45 circles in the figure 7.7. Number 45 is the 9th pyramidal number: 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9 = 45.

## Class 3

![FOL class 3 a](/media/fol-class-3.png){caption=1}
![FOL class 3 b](/media/fol-class-3-helper.png){caption=1}
<!-- clear -->

The class 3 is the "real" FOL according to D. Melchizedek. It is not as common as other classes and one could argue, if there is any special meaning attached to this particular symbol, or if it just the same motif than classes 1 and 2. Formation brings no new elements compared to classes 1 and 2. But bigger the formation goes, the level of difficulty increases. Early occurrences of this symbol are debatable. The FOL in Abydos still needs examination. The FOL class 3 as a background model of the Pre-Hittite sun symbol presented in this complementary document is speculative in nature. The first occurrence of the FOL class 3 comes from the Marlik silver goblet, 1400 - 1100 BC. Then it appears on the Near East silver beaker in 600 BC. Again Roman mosaics uses the class 3 and so does wall drawings in Syria (729 AD), which are particularly intriguing. Numerous woodworkers from various countries in the Common Era used this form and have maintained the tradition until our days. [Item 1](newitems.html#item-1) and [item 2 a](newitems.html#item-2-a-b-c) in this complementary document contains the class 3 FOL.

Mathematical properties of the class 3 symbol elements are interesting, especially number of circles needed to construct the symbol, which is 19 for the figure 7.8 and 55 for the figure 7.9. Number 55 is the tenth number (greater than 0) on the triangular number sequence called pyramidal number: 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10 = 55. Number 55 is also the tenth fibonacci number greater than 0: 1<sub>1</sub>, 1<sub>2</sub>, 2<sub>3</sub>, 3<sub>4</sub>, 5<sub>5</sub>, 8<sub>6</sub>, 13<sub>7</sub>, 21<sub>8</sub>, 34<sub>9</sub>, 55<sub>10</sub>,... It is the largest Fibonacci number to be a triangular number.

Intersections points counts 37 for the figure 7.8 and 73 for the figure 7.9. 37 and 73 are mirror numbers. 73 is the 21st prime number. 37 is the 12th prime number. 21 and 12 are again mirror numbers, and further 21 is 3\*7 or 7\*3 so we can speak of nested recursive mirror number sequence here. Other curiosity is that the "Plato's lambda" (1,2,4,8 + 1,3,9,27) adds up to 55.

#### Class 1, 2, and 3 mathematical properties and options

Classes 1, 2, and 3 are central forms of the FOL variations which I want to spend more time for analysis. Each of them has mathematical properties and options calculated in the following manner:


##### Mathematical properties

1. Number of *circles* that are needed to construct the symbol
2. Number of intersection *points* that are present in the construction
3. Number of *leaves* that are present in the construction
4. Minimum (*w_min*) and maximum (*w_max*) width of the symbol 
5. Number of concave *triangles* that are countable on the construction

Each of them can be calculated from inner and outer part of the construction giving two options:

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li>Inside the formation</li>
<li>Inside + outside the formation combined</li>
</ol>

Circles needed in total inside the formation is a bit arbitrary because the FOL needs to have partial circles / arcs to be fully formed as a symbol. In this case, one should pay attention to the option b, combined value of the inside and outside objects.

The count of leaves is a bit arbitrary on the option b because there are half-formatted leaves on the outer part of the motif. As a result, only fully formed leaves are counted in the case of the option b.

Width of the motif has two values because of the hexagonal shape of the FOL which has two different diagonals. Longer (max.) diagonal value is the vertex of the hexagon. Shorter (min.) diagonal value related to the square root 3 is the apothem of the hexagon.

Concave triangles inside the FOL are exactly countable, but on the outer formation, we can see partly formed concave triangles so I have counted only fully symmetrical triangles on the option b.

|class|option|circles|points|leaves|w_min|w_max|triangles|
| --- | ---- | ----- | ---- | ---- | --- | --- | ------- |
|1|a|1 |7 |12 |1    |1    |6 |
|1|b|13|19|18 |2    |2.732|24|
|2|a|7 |19|42 |1.732|2    |24|
|2|b|45|37|60 |3    |3.464|60|
|3|a|19|37|90 |2.598|3    |54|
|3|b|55|73|120|4    |4.330|96|


## Class n

There is practically no limit how many layers of circles you can draw on the FOL motif. Just a minority of artifacts shows greater than class 3 formation of the FOL however. [The Idalion cup](http://artifacts.flowerofliferesearch.com/2000-0bc.html#fig6.1.6) has the class 5 FOL and actually the "fruit of life" symbol presented by D. Melchizedek would fit inside the Idalion cup formation. [The bronze vessel](http://artifacts.flowerofliferesearch.com/2000-0bc.html#fig6.1.7) from Nimrud has an extraordinary big formation, the class 8 FOL.


## Class p

![FOL Pattern](/media/folpattern.png){caption=1 width=300 style="border: 1px solid #aaa"}

The class p means a pattern-like or an ornament-like formation of the FOL. This is quite typical among the other classes. [Item 5](newitems.html#item-5) and [item 8](newitems.html#item-8) in this book goes to this category. Pre-Indus ceramic ornament (2500 BC) is the earliest reference of the FOL and goes to the class p. From 800 - 600 BC many items like the Ivory tusk, the plaque, and the cosmetic pyxis from Nimrud, Terracotta torsos from Cyprus and stone floor sills from Iraq, all belong to the class p. The church pavement from London (1600 AD) uses this formation. One undated Assyrian wall decoration is also going under the class p.

One notable feature difference between the Cownose and the Flower of Life is that the Cownose pattern is almost without exceptions found in an ornament / pattern form. It is clearly not used similar way than the FOL is in classes 1, 2, and 3, where the symbol is enclosed by a circular form.
