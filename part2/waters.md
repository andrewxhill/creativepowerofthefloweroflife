## Sweet and salty waters

On Mesopotamian myths special flowers/trees were constantly associated with the water element, underworld streams and lakes from the creation of the world. Underworld sea/god, Apsu<!-- cite author="wikipedia.org" title="Abzu" date="" location="" type="website" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abzu" --> was believed to be a source of all rivers and fresh sweet waters, a nourishing liquid of sacred plants, trees and fruits. Somewhere from the deep waters came up seven wise men<!-- cite author="wikipedia.org" title="Apkallu" date="" location="" type="website" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apkallu" --> who taught knowledge and civilized arts to humankind and then disappeared again. But there was also another kind of sea, salty sea of Tiamat goddess (or Thalassa in Greek), who was the serpent of Chaos, the great Dragon. It is always too daring to talk in the mouth of the ancients, but there may have been people, who understood that these two forces are but two sides of the One force<!-- cite author="" title="Out of the mouth of the most High proceedeth not evil and good?" date="" location="Book of Lamentations 3:38" type="selfref" href="#" --> and mixture of them is the creation of the worlds. Raise of the monotheism on the other hand supports this view of the One principle, but on the other hand monotheism didn't stop people competing and violently promoting the strongest, the highest and the latest ideology of God of their own. Quite opposite. Destroying, refuting and replacing old religions and belief systems with new ones was ongoing process. Interesting is the fact that even appearances and customs of replaced religions were gone, symbology of theirs transformed and continued on new forms.

Once followed the story of the Fleur-de-lis, it becomes apparent that once upon the time the heraldic symbol was associated with six-petalled flowers like a lily and an iris<!-- cite author="" title="Iris has 3 standards upright petals plus 3 falls (hang down). Iris as a rainbow goddess is not without mythical connotations either: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_(mythology)" date="" location="" type="selfref" href="#" -->
. From those flowers lily with pomegranate fruit was in close connection to the Tree of Life and the Menorah. Earlier in history a lily was mixed by etymology and possibly by aromatic usage and cultic means with a blue Egyptian water lily (lotus in further East) which was part of the Tree of Life motif. Smell of the lotus meant a presence of gods and and by the scent of the flower one would be one with the gods.

Roots deep in primordial waters the Tree of Life presented life force and knowledge suck beneath the ground and materialized in the six petal formed plants, lily flower and pomegranate fruit. Kings of nations and Priests of religions were regarded as guardians of the knowledge but real key holders might have been mystic sects who emphasized personal transformation rather than transformation orchestrated by formal constitutions.

I think this is the meaning of the scenery on silver and golden goblets found from Marlik. Base of the goblet with the FOL symbol represents twofold waters, sweet and salty. Monsters getting up from the sea are in the fight, like cosmos and chaos. On the other end we see serpents awakening and on the other end eagles flying free. Goblets that were used on ceremonies were full of meaning. Sip of the drink was for liberation of the earthly worries and troubles. It depended from the subject, if he was about to get in drunk or to realize the meaning of life and death. Mycenaean Golden Rosettes from 1600 BC with the FOL class 1 are special attachments for dead royals. Funerary cosmetic boxes from Thebes having the FOL symbol in the lid may have contained fragrances and perfumes of the flowers we have just talked about. This just adds the holistic appearance of the FOL symbol. It speaks with smells, tastes, for our eyes, ears and every sense.

The Fleur-de-lis / a lily / an iris can be seen basicly the same symbol with the Flower of Life (and Death), but the former is presented from the side view when the latter, the FOL, is presented from the top bird view. The FOL pattern as an ornamentation could be called **the Field of Lilies**, or the field of six-petal flowers in more general way. It is just a matter of the view of point to see it, very first things geometrical introspections wishes to teach us.
