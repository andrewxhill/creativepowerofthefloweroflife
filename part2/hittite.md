## Hittite sun discs

To get convinced of the bronze age origin of the geometrical ideas of squares and equilateral triangles, we can take a look to the Pre-Hittite religious standards. Excavations started at 1910s by a german archaeology team in Alacahöyük<!-- cite author="turkishculture.org" title="Turkish Culture Portal - Alacahöyük" date="" location="" type="website" href="http://www.turkishculture.org/archaeology/alacahoyuk-1085.htm" -->, central Turkey, and later continued by a turkish team whose work was personally funded by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, revealed objects known as the Hittite Sun.

Object are visible in the Anatolian Civilization Museum, Ankara, Turkey. Eventually Hittite Sun symbol became the emblem of Ankara city itself.

Dating of the objects goes actually back to the Pre-Hittite civilization called Hattusa around 2500 BC, the early bronze age. Again there are no written texts telling their meaning. Earliest mentions of Hattis and their history comes from Hittite sources in the second millennium BC. The most apparent motif in the Hittite Sun disc no doubt is the bull symbol with symmetrical horns, which is imitated on many other related objects<!-- cite author="pinterest.com" title="Hittite Sun Standards" date="2016" location="" type="website" href="https://fi.pinterest.com/markomanninen/hittite-sun-standards/" --> found from the archaeological site. Also the disc as a symbol of the Sun looks like the most suitable one. Sometimes a half crescent disc above the head of the bull was also the Moon.

But what interests us the most, is the geometrical formation inside the disc. The most famous Hittite sun disc standard seems to get a form from the square lattice model, which in turn can be found from the Cownose model as described below.

Other, although not so famous, Hittite sun disc contains a hexagonal grid, which can be found from the overlapping circles model, the Flower of Life, as presented below.

Perfect round shape of the first disc indicates that appreciation of the circular form was intentional. Maybe aging and rust has distorted the exact formation of the latter hexagonal disc, or the formation exceeded skills of the bronze age smith. But I think it is notable that these two formations based on the square root 2 and 3 geometry co-existed so early and that the square root 2 formation is again far more common.

Of the several dozens of sun disc standards, I have found only the above one following hexagonal pattern. If model used on the formation of the latter disc was based on the overlapping circles, then it would the earliest perfect FOL (class 3) available. Yet the exact date of the FOL in Abydos still remains unconfirmed and can change the fact. It would also mean that the FOL was known both in Indus valley and Hattusa in the middle of the third millennium BC.

To get more textual data for investigation we need to move from the bronze age to the second and the first millennium BC. My particular interest here is to examine some semitic and greek tales and mytho-religious accounts, which may relate to the FOL symbolism.
