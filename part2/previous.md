# Part 2: Meaning of the symbol

Since my research in autumn 2014, a lot has happened. In the summer of 2015, I made another research trip to Cyprus and Malta. This is because these islands were mentioned on many occasions when I read about the history of the neolithic cultures and their use of geometrical art and symbols. Although not as numerous as in the previous research document, the new items discovered on the trips are still interesting and valuable for further speculation. Especially the old ivory item found from Cyprus with the FOL class 2 motif on a pitted background gives evidential weight for a wider existence of the symbol in around 1500 BC.

I have prepared a classification system for different variations of the symbol to improve categorization and to better define discussion fields for the topic. Classification is already used in this complimentary document. I have placed all previous items from the original research document under the new classifications in this article to help to see interrelations between them.


## Previous work

Due to some publicity I got via channels where the research was published, a few persons interested in the topic gave me more FOL items to catalog. Flower of Life mystery<!-- cite author="Marko Manninen" title="Flower of Life mystery WordPress site" date="2014" location="" type="blog" href="https://floweroflifemystery.wordpress.com" --> WordPress site is still the main (blog type) site for the research. Flower of Life history Pinterest<!-- cite author="Marko Manninen" title="Flower of Life history Pinterest site" date="2014" location="" type="website" href="https://www.pinterest.com/markomanninen/flower-of-life-history/" --> pin-board is continuously used to collect new pictures of items containing the FOL. A Facebook page<!-- cite author="Marko Manninen" title="Flower of Life history Facebook page" date="2014" location="" type="website" href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Flower-of-Life-History/1510656742537643" --> created for FOL community actions was kindly promoted a few times by Jamie Janover on the Resonance project<!-- cite author="resonance.is" title="Resonance Project Foundation" date="" location="" type="website" href="https://www.facebook.com/TheResonanceProject" -->. In addition to these, the first book was published on academia.edu<!-- cite author="Marko Manninen" title="Flower of Life artifacts at academia.edu" date="2014" location="" type="website" href="https://www.academia.edu/9644620/Artifacts_of_the_Flower_of_Life" --> and issuu.com<!-- cite author="Marko Manninen" title="Flower of Life artifacts at issuu.com" date="2014" location="" type="website" href="http://issuu.com/markotapiomanninen/docs/artifacts_of_the_flower_of_life" -->. All channels together have given around 10000 views for the previous research document during the past year.

The Wikipedia page that I was referring to a year back as a source for a collection of occurrences of the Flower of Life symbol was deleted by Wikipedia moderators on May 2015 and it is now having a totally different topic of Manga comics related content. Reason is given on the discussion page as “delete due to a lack of notability”<!-- cite author="wikipedia.org" title="Wikipedia Flower of Life discussion page" date="" location="" type="website" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Flower_of_Life_(2nd_nomination)" -->. Supposedly, the page was seen as a promotion page for the controversial ideas of D. Melchizedek, but it still was a very valuable source of the topic. Now gone, but only from the space of Wikipedia. For curious readers with referential interest, the archive.org<!-- cite author="archive.org" title="Flower of Life archive" date="" location="" type="website" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20150413033856/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flower_of_Life" --> site has somewhat readable version of the old page. More recently Wikimedia moderators accepted to use part of the old Flower of Life -content as a part of the Overlapping circles -page<!-- cite author="wikipedia.org" title="Wikipedia Overlapping circles page" date="" location="" type="website" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overlapping_circles_grid#Modern_usage" -->.

I don’t know what is notable for moderators, but I see the FOL symbol all around the modern world on T-shirts, jewelry, lamps, decoration, even on technological inventions. The FOL pattern as well as Cownose pattern was examined by Da Vinci and hopefully my research can show it was examined already 3500 - 4000 years ago. Maybe not exactly with the name “Flower of Life”, but because people are already using that popularized name, it would be a shame if Wikipedia can not provide information about the symbol with the most known and most commonly used term. I’m sure alternative formally constructed names like **concave equilateral triangle tiling** or just **intersecting circles** will never be as conducive.
