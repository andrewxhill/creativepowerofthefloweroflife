## Partnership between lilies and pomegranates

What makes the lily interesting is a six-petal appearance of it. In Hebrew language the female name Susanna (Shoshannah), the lily flower (shoshana) and the number six (shesh) are possibly from the same word root. The lily is often presented with another plant dear and meaningful for the people in the Near East and India, i.e. the pomegranate fruit (punica granatum<!-- cite author="wikipedia.org" title="Pomegranate" date="" location="" type="website" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomegranate" -->). The pomegranate, especially in Israel, often has six petals first on a flower development stage and consequently on the other end of the ripe fruit there is a six shaped persistent calyx or crown.

Lilies (as different types of palmettes) and pomegranates are both almost exclusively present on the ancient hybrid Tree of Life illustrations and they are common among buried funerary items. According to the Books of Kings<!-- cite author="" title="Old Testament" date="" location="1 Kings 7:17-19" type="selfref" href="#" -->, capitals of the two pillars that stood in the front of Solomon's Temple in Jerusalem were engraved with pomegranates and lilies. Two pillars in the temple of Solomon made of silver and gold (pillars of cloud and fire) represent similar change of light and darkness. In the book of Judges, the Samson (day) was taken over by Delilah (night, de'lily’h), but after a while, Samson took over Delilah again by breaking apart the two pillars of the temple of the fish-god Dagon<!-- cite author="wikipedia.org" title="Samson" date="" location="" type="website" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samson#Death" -->. Gold bells and pomegranates were attached to the hem of the robe of the jewish High Priest as we can read from the Exodus<!-- cite author="" title="Old Testament" date="" location="Exodus 28:33-34, 39:25" type="selfref" href="#" -->.

There is an evidence that the six-spoked pomegranate was used as a religious symbol in Israel already in the 14-13th century BC. The picture 4.5.1 is a thumb size object made of ivory representing the pomegranate<!-- cite author="wikipedia.org" title="Ivory pomegranate" date="" location="" type="website" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivory_pomegranate" -->. The picture 4.5.2 is a reverse side of the coin issued by the Jewish rebels in 68 AD<!-- cite author="wikipedia.org" title="First Jewish Revolt coinage" date="" location="" type="website" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Jewish_Revolt_coinage" --> which has three pomegranates in the middle of it.

This is a good example, how only half of the pegs are shown on each pomegranate, when they are depicted from the side view. But, if you would look them from the top view, in a row the pegs would make 6+6+6. The same applies to the lily symbol according to Dr. Ze'ev Goldmann<!-- cite author="Dr. Ze'ev Goldmann" title="Star of David" date="2008" location="" type="website" href="http://zeevgoldmann.blogspot.fi/2008/08/ii-star-of-david-on-mosaic-floor-at-ein.html" -->:

> The Shoshanim had to be full-size as seen from above, that is six-petalled, as the pillars stood free in front of the Temple, while the capitals of the two engaged pillars in the vestibule had to be tri-petalled, as seen from the side. In its six-petalled form, as well as in the tri-petalled side-view, the Lily came to be the paramount ornament of Jewish art and especially of Jerusalem’s ossuary decoration.

Harum-scarum or just provocative, Pope Paul VI (1968-1978) was entitled "Flos Florum" or Flower of Flowers and his coat of arms contained three lilies (see Fleur-de-lis on the top picture 4.5.3 and at the top of the head of the winged genie on the picture 3.2.4), again resulting 6+6+6. A small clarification here might be in place. My intention is not to agitate hexakosioihexekontahexaphobia. Through careful analysis religious-mystic history seems to show, that 6, with its multiples, was not considered exclusively evil, bad or unlucky. More or less it should be recognized as a dancing seed in the Yin-Yang symbol, where opposites relatively oscillate and alter their positions constantly.

Below we can see lily flowers from the side (picture 4.5.4) and the top view (picture 4.5.5). It further visualizes the idea of six being the original three plus the mirror of three together.

The Greek mythology shares the same mysticism for the number six. Hera, the very prominent figure in the ancient Greek art, is said to have held the pomegranate and the lily in her hands. Boeotians called both the lily and the pomegranate with the same name: sida/side<!-- cite author="Krzysztof Tomasz Witczak" title="On The Anatolian Origin Of Ancient Greek σίδη" date="2012" location="Page 115" type="book" href="https://digilib.phil.muni.cz/bitstream/handle/11222.digilib/131952/1_GraecoLatinaBrunensia_19-2014-2_9.pdf" --> giving a name to the famous fermented pear/apple drink later in history. Moreover Persephone<!-- cite author="wikipedia.org" title="Persephone" date="" location="" type="website" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persephone" -->, on her trips between two worlds, finally ate six seeds of the pomegranate (number of seeds vary on some versions of the story). Seasons of the year are said to correlate with her coming and going so that during the autumn/winter (six months) Persephone lives down with Hades and during the spring/summer (six months) she blooms the Earth with Demeter. Cyclical association of the pomegranate fruit is discussed for example by Matt Bennett on his journal article: *The Pomegranate: Marker of Cyclical Time, Seeds of Eternity*<!-- cite author="Matt Bennett" title="The Pomegranate: Marker of Cyclical Time, Seeds of Eternity" date="2011" location="" type="book" href="http://www.ijhssnet.com/journals/Vol_1_No_19_December_2011/7.pdf" -->.
