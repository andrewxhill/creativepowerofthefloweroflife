## Life and death drama

These all are examples that witness the widespread mixing of these two plants. They both have something to do with life and death that is: with seasonal change of light and darkness, the Sun (source) and the Moon (reflection). The lily has kept its twofold meaning until our days because it is still the flower of death and the most common fragrance in funerals, after possible aromatic incenses of course. But at the same time the lily, especially the Madonna lily is a symbol of purity, radiance and innocence, possibly in the way Leonardo wanted to use it on his Annunciation -painting<!-- cite author="wikipedia.org" title="Annunciation (Leonardo)" date="" location="" type="website" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annunciation_(Leonardo)" --> passing by the old tradition of the scenery.

Although lilies and multiple "sixes" are taken as a symbol of death, we can't think of them symbolizing only the sad annihilation side of the fleshy existence of man, but also a moment of rebirth, resurrection and initiation. A willful baptism rite (a ritual bath before service) on a large basin with a brim that was *like the calyx of a lily*<!-- cite author="wikipedia.org" title="Molten Sea" date="" location="" type="website" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molten_Sea" -->, is a transmutation process where a man becomes a fish by diving deep to the ocean of chaos and then comes back to life as a perfected man of cosmos ready to enter the temple. If this happens, and when a human being is fortunate to experience it while alive, he becomes half a fish and half a man, or just a fisherman. If not physical, the effect of death may spiritually have been total and irreversible so that the initiated human being has lost the false sense of self and retained true selfless servantism and altruism, if modern interpretation is allowed here. Few hundreds years before common era we can see this kind of allegorical and ideological thinking getting new heights. In the Christian era it was already common to speak about the second death or spiritual death of an ego<!-- cite author="" title="New Testament" date="" location="Galatians 2:20, Ephesians 4:22-24" type="selfref" href="#" --> meaning that common symbols of actual physical death or afterlife could have been associated with death and rebirth by means of more psychological and spiritual sense.

Symbology is pretty consistent with this big drama scene over the ages and cultures. *Lila* (sanskr.), the play of life is smartly played on the small story of The Fairy Tale of the Green Snake and the Beautiful Lily<!-- cite author="Johann Wolfgang von Goethe" title="The Fairy Tale of the Green Snake and the Beautiful Lily - See more at: http://wn.rsarchive.org/RelAuthors/GoetheJW/GreenSnake.html#sthash.USY93QFo.dpuf" date="1795" location="" type="Novel" href="http://wn.rsarchive.org/RelAuthors/GoetheJW/GreenSnake.html" --> by Goethe. When the fair Lily, accompanied with her ever pleasing harp playing (reminds of Väinämöinen), was on the point of taking leave, the green Snake caught the last lines of the song:

> What can these many signs avail me?<br/>
	My Singer's Death, thy coal black Hand?<br/>
	This Dog of Onyx, that can never fail me?<br/>
	And coming at the Lamp's command?<br/>

> From human joys removed forever,<br/>
	With sorrows compassed round I sit:<br/>
	Is there a Temple at the River?<br/>
	Is there a Bridge? Alas, not yet!

Once the temple is ready and arosen from the river, the snake was praised and ending of the story incorporates the familiar scene of the Hawk and the Sun, or winged sun disk<!-- cite author="wikipedia.org" title="Winged sun" date="" location="" type="website" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winged_sun" --> as it is better known:

> At this instant the Hawk with the mirror soared aloft above the dome; caught the light of the Sun, and reflected it upon the group, which was standing on the Altar. The King, the Queen, and their attendants, in the dusky concave of the Temple, seemed illuminated by a heavenly splendour, and the people fell upon their faces.
