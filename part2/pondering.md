## Pondering the name

In part 1 I have specified geometrical base components with some etymological ideas around the FOL, and I have repeatedly made notes about a similar geometrical shape from Old Babylonian times called Cownose or Apsamikkum. Now it is time to move forward and give more descriptive ideas of the FOL symbol.

The basic idea of "flowering" is too evident for the six-petal rosette base of the pattern that it could be ignored totally as a possible pattern name for the ancients. The first thing is to find out what kind of words ancients used for:

* a general noun for flower or specific six-petal flower species<!-- cite author="mywildflowers.com" title="Search for example: http://www.mywildflowers.com" date="" location="" type="website" href="http://mywildflowers.com/searchflowers.asp?mode=identify&fshape=fform=%27regular%27%20AND%20rays%3E=6%20AND%20rays%3C=6&leaf=&color=&month=&form=&height=&bloomsize=&cluster=&itype=flower&startAt=0" --> like lilies, lotuses, roses and such that have been notable for a long time in the history
* adjectives that are related to a flower in general or specific shape, color, smell or other more abstract descriptions (for example white, shining, colourful, elite, innocent, aromatic, six-petalled, cupped)
* verbs related to a flower like "to blossom", "to prosper", "to thrive"

Other objects, adverbs and verbs that should be considered are:

* nets, filters, covers, holders for example: fishing, hair, spider nets, fields and planes having triangular, rhombic or hexagonal pattern, perimeter, sieve, etc.
* descriptive terms like: bindable, collectable, strong, durable, curved, concave, circular, eternal, angular, etc.
* verbs like: “to collect”, “to hold”, “to bind”, “to surround”, “to catch”

At first the task seems overwhelming and impossible. The FOL decoration has been found from various geographies at different times during a period roughly 4500 years long. Origin of the FOL goes probably beyond civilizations and cultures when the modern writing system had not developed but only ideogrammatic writing and oral communication were established. We should be able to read dictionaries, understand texts and find etymological traces in many strange languages that disappeared for two thousands years like Egyptian hieroglyphs or Assyrian cuneiform scripts that then got deciphered again only two hundred years ago. Not to forget many of the cultures that are totally gone and lost to the history like Marlik, that is not mentioned in any ancient texts. So far, there is no ancient document found describing the make of the exact FOL symbol or ornament, so we can only simulate the creation of it. We have goblets, pyxes, ivory items, whorls, discs, vessels, funerary objects and mosaics having the FOL ornament on them, but only guesses how and why they were done.

To make a comparison, a very famous motif of the ancients, the Tree of Life<!-- cite author="wikipedia.org" title="Tree of life" date="" location="" type="website" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_of_life" --> is in a similar position. Although so extensively used by various cultures, there are no ancient texts that really explain what was meant with the motif. Tree of Life symbolism can be seen as an example of symbolic tradition where we can mainly use analogies and comparative methods to find out possible meanings of the motif.

After a second look at the task, we however have a bit more to say about the FOL. We have contexts where and when items having the FOL symbol existed. Previous knowledge of the cultures greatly helps to get at least a general idea of the ongoing development of the collective mathematical and geometrical intelligence of ancient people. We also have the old mathematical documents describing specifically the geometry and coefficients of the square root 2 and 3 ratio or the square and the equilateral triangle respectively. What we have are leads good enough to be able to make sophisticated conjectures, if not definite answers.
