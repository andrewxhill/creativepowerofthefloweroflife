# Part 2: Meaning of the symbol

Since my research in autumn 2014, a lot has happened. In the summer of 2015, I made another research trip to Cyprus and Malta. This is because these islands were mentioned on many occasions when I read about the history of the neolithic cultures and their use of geometrical art and symbols. Although not as numerous as in the previous research document, the new items discovered on the trips are still interesting and valuable for further speculation. Especially the old ivory item found from Cyprus with the FOL class 2 motif on a pitted background gives evidential weight for a wider existence of the symbol in around 1500 BC.

I have prepared a classification system for different variations of the symbol to improve categorization and to better define discussion fields for the topic. Classification is already used in this complimentary document. I have placed all previous items from the original research document under the new classifications in this article to help to see interrelations between them.

## Previous work

Due to some publicity I got via channels where the research was published, a few persons interested in the topic gave me more FOL items to catalog. Flower of Life mystery<!-- cite author="Marko Manninen" title="Flower of Life mystery WordPress site" date="2014" location="" type="blog" href="https://floweroflifemystery.wordpress.com" --> WordPress site is still the main (blog type) site for the research. Flower of Life history Pinterest<!-- cite author="Marko Manninen" title="Flower of Life history Pinterest site" date="2014" location="" type="website" href="https://www.pinterest.com/markomanninen/flower-of-life-history/" --> pin-board is continuously used to collect new pictures of items containing the FOL. A Facebook page<!-- cite author="Marko Manninen" title="Flower of Life history Facebook page" date="2014" location="" type="website" href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Flower-of-Life-History/1510656742537643" --> created for FOL community actions was kindly promoted a few times by Jamie Janover on the Resonance project<!-- cite author="resonance.is" title="Resonance Project Foundation" date="" location="" type="website" href="https://www.facebook.com/TheResonanceProject" -->. In addition to these, the first book was published on academia.edu<!-- cite author="Marko Manninen" title="Flower of Life artifacts at academia.edu" date="2014" location="" type="website" href="https://www.academia.edu/9644620/Artifacts_of_the_Flower_of_Life" --> and issuu.com<!-- cite author="Marko Manninen" title="Flower of Life artifacts at issuu.com" date="2014" location="" type="website" href="http://issuu.com/markotapiomanninen/docs/artifacts_of_the_flower_of_life" -->. All channels together have given around 10000 views for the previous research document during the past year.

The Wikipedia page that I was referring to a year back as a source for a collection of occurrences of the Flower of Life symbol was deleted by Wikipedia moderators on May 2015 and it is now having a totally different topic of Manga comics related content. Reason is given on the discussion page as “delete due to a lack of notability”<!-- cite author="wikipedia.org" title="Wikipedia Flower of Life discussion page" date="" location="" type="website" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Flower_of_Life_(2nd_nomination)" -->. Supposedly, the page was seen as a promotion page for the controversial ideas of D. Melchizedek, but it still was a very valuable source of the topic. Now gone, but only from the space of Wikipedia. For curious readers with referential interest, the archive.org<!-- cite author="archive.org" title="Flower of Life archive" date="" location="" type="website" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20150413033856/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flower_of_Life" --> site has somewhat readable version of the old page. More recently Wikimedia moderators accepted to use part of the old Flower of Life -content as a part of the Overlapping circles -page<!-- cite author="wikipedia.org" title="Wikipedia Overlapping circles page" date="" location="" type="website" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overlapping_circles_grid#Modern_usage" -->.

I don’t know what is notable for moderators, but I see the FOL symbol all around the modern world on T-shirts, jewelry, lamps, decoration, even on technological inventions. The FOL pattern as well as Cownose pattern was examined by Da Vinci and hopefully my research can show it was examined already 3500 - 4000 years ago. Maybe not exactly with the name “Flower of Life”, but because people are already using that popularized name, it would be a shame if Wikipedia can not provide information about the symbol with the most known and most commonly used term. I’m sure alternative formally constructed names like **concave equilateral triangle tiling** or just **intersecting circles** will never be as conducive.

## Pondering the name

In part 1 I have specified geometrical base components with some etymological ideas around the FOL, and I have repeatedly made notes about a similar geometrical shape from Old Babylonian times called Cownose or Apsamikkum. Now it is time to move forward and give more descriptive ideas of the FOL symbol.

The basic idea of "flowering" is too evident for the six-petal rosette base of the pattern that it could be ignored totally as a possible pattern name for the ancients. The first thing is to find out what kind of words ancients used for:

* a general noun for flower or specific six-petal flower species<!-- cite author="mywildflowers.com" title="Search for example: http://www.mywildflowers.com" date="" location="" type="website" href="http://mywildflowers.com/searchflowers.asp?mode=identify&fshape=fform=%27regular%27%20AND%20rays%3E=6%20AND%20rays%3C=6&leaf=&color=&month=&form=&height=&bloomsize=&cluster=&itype=flower&startAt=0" --> like lilies, lotuses, roses and such that have been notable for a long time in the history
* adjectives that are related to a flower in general or specific shape, color, smell or other more abstract descriptions (for example white, shining, colourful, elite, innocent, aromatic, six-petalled, cupped)
* verbs related to a flower like "to blossom", "to prosper", "to thrive"

Other objects, adverbs and verbs that should be considered are:

* nets, filters, covers, holders for example: fishing, hair, spider nets, fields and planes having triangular, rhombic or hexagonal pattern, perimeter, sieve, etc.
* descriptive terms like: bindable, collectable, strong, durable, curved, concave, circular, eternal, angular, etc.
* verbs like: “to collect”, “to hold”, “to bind”, “to surround”, “to catch”

At first the task seems overwhelming and impossible. The FOL decoration has been found from various geographies at different times during a period roughly 4500 years long. Origin of the FOL goes probably beyond civilizations and cultures when the modern writing system had not developed but only ideogrammatic writing and oral communication were established. We should be able to read dictionaries, understand texts and find etymological traces in many strange languages that disappeared for two thousands years like Egyptian hieroglyphs or Assyrian cuneiform scripts that then got deciphered again only two hundred years ago. Not to forget many of the cultures that are totally gone and lost to the history like Marlik, that is not mentioned in any ancient texts. So far, there is no ancient document found describing the make of the exact FOL symbol or ornament, so we can only simulate the creation of it. We have goblets, pyxes, ivory items, whorls, discs, vessels, funerary objects and mosaics having the FOL ornament on them, but only guesses how and why they were done.

To make a comparison, a very famous motif of the ancients, the Tree of Life<!-- cite author="wikipedia.org" title="Tree of life" date="" location="" type="website" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_of_life" --> is in a similar position. Although so extensively used by various cultures, there are no ancient texts that really explain what was meant with the motif. Tree of Life symbolism can be seen as an example of symbolic tradition where we can mainly use analogies and comparative methods to find out possible meanings of the motif.

After a second look at the task, we however have a bit more to say about the FOL. We have contexts where and when items having the FOL symbol existed. Previous knowledge of the cultures greatly helps to get at least a general idea of the ongoing development of the collective mathematical and geometrical intelligence of ancient people. We also have the old mathematical documents describing specifically the geometry and coefficients of the square root 2 and 3 ratio or the square and the equilateral triangle respectively. What we have are leads good enough to be able to make sophisticated conjectures, if not definite answers.

## Hittite sun discs

To get convinced of the bronze age origin of the geometrical ideas of squares and equilateral triangles, we can take a look to the Pre-Hittite religious standards. Excavations started at 1910s by a german archaeology team in Alacahöyük<!-- cite author="turkishculture.org" title="Turkish Culture Portal - Alacahöyük" date="" location="" type="website" href="http://www.turkishculture.org/archaeology/alacahoyuk-1085.htm" -->, central Turkey, and later continued by a turkish team whose work was personally funded by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, revealed objects known as the Hittite Sun. 

![The most famous Hittite sun disc standard](/media/prehittitesun1.jpg){caption=1}
![Rarely presented Hittite sun disc standard](/media/prehittitesun2.jpg){caption=1}
<!-- clear -->

Object are visible in the Anatolian Civilization Museum, Ankara, Turkey. Eventually Hittite Sun symbol became the emblem of Ankara city itself.

Dating of the objects goes actually back to the Pre-Hittite civilization called Hattusa around 2500 BC, the early bronze age. Again there are no written texts telling their meaning. Earliest mentions of Hattis and their history comes from Hittite sources in the second millennium BC. The most apparent motif in the Hittite Sun disc no doubt is the bull symbol with symmetrical horns, which is imitated on many other related objects<!-- cite author="pinterest.com" title="Hittite Sun Standards" date="2016" location="" type="website" href="https://fi.pinterest.com/markomanninen/hittite-sun-standards/" --> found from the archaeological site. Also the disc as a symbol of the Sun looks like the most suitable one. Sometimes a half crescent disc above the head of the bull was also the Moon.

But what interests us the most, is the geometrical formation inside the disc. The most famous Hittite sun disc standard seems to get a form from the square lattice model, which in turn can be found from the Cownose model as described below.

![Hittite sun disc standard with geometric design](/media/hittitesun1.png){caption=1}

![Apsamikkum (Cownose)](/media/hittitesun1circlemodel.png){caption=1}
![Equilateral rectangle lattice](/media/hittitesun1squaremodel.png){caption=1}
<!-- clear -->

Other, not so famous disc contains a hexagonal grid, which can be found from the overlapping circles model, the Flower of Life, as presented below.

![Hittite sun disc standard with geometric design](/media/hittitesun2.png){caption=1}

![Flower of Life](/media/hittitesun2circlemodel.png){caption=1}
![Equilateral triangle lattice](/media/hittitesun2trianglemodel.png){caption=1}
<!-- clear -->

Perfect round shape of the first disc indicates that appreciation of the circular form was intentional. Maybe aging and rust has distorted the exact formation of the latter hexagonal disc, or the formation exceeded skills of the bronze age smith. But I think it is notable that these two formations based on the square root 2 and 3 geometry co-existed so early and that the square root 2 formation is again far more common.

Of the several dozens of sun disc standards, I have found only the above one following hexagonal pattern. If model used on the formation of the latter disc was based on the overlapping circles, then it would the earliest perfect FOL (class 3) available. Yet the exact date of the FOL in Abydos still remains unconfirmed and can change the fact. It would also mean that the FOL was known both in Indus valley and Hattusa in the middle of the third millennium BC.

To get more textual data for investigation we need to move from the bronze age to the second and the first millennium BC. My particular interest here is to examine some semitic and greek tales and mytho-religious accounts, which may relate to the FOL symbolism.

## Fleur-de-lis as a part of the Tree of Life

When a year back I wrote that the Fleur-de-lis<!-- cite author="wikipedia.org" title="Fleur de lis" date="" location="" type="website" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fleur-de-lis" --> and the Tree of Life shouldn't be mixed with the Flower of Life, I should have been more precise and careful with my wording. Although those symbols are seemingly different by shape, they seem to share very similar connective origins in the past. So similar that the Tree of Life can be seen as a more sophisticated and complex form of a sacred flower with all components: roots, stem, leaves, buds, fruits and seeds. In the Appendix A of the The Assyrian Tree Of Life<!-- cite author="Simo Parpola" title="The Assyrian Tree Of Life" date="1993" location="Appendix A" type="article" href="http://www.atour.com/education/pdf/SimoParpola-TheAssyrianTreeOfLife.pdf" --> Simo Parpola shows how simple flower and complex tree ideograms can actually describe the same ideological motif.

In Jewish tradition, the Tree of Life was symbolized with a six branched candlestick called the Menorah<!-- cite author="" title="See: The Assyrian Tree of Life and the Jewish Menorah by Christos G. Karagiannis, The Menorah, the Ancient Seven-armed Candelabrum: Origin, Form, and Significance by Rahel Haklili and The tree of light: A study of the menorah, the seven-branched lampstand by Leon Yarden" date="" location="" type="selfref" href="#" -->. The seventh center stem of the candle is called Shamash (the Sun) which brings structure to the familiar 6 and 7 divisioning mentioned in the previous Part 1. 

A relief that is on the Arch of Titus in Rome<!-- cite author="wikipedia.org" title="Menorah Temple" date="" location="" type="website" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menorah_(Temple)#History_and_fate" --> has a depiction of the Menorah that stands on a hexagonal podium. There is a fascinating association of the Menorah to the oval shaped mandorla/almond symbol (ie. the Vesica Piscis) which is present in the FOL as we have learned. Quote from Exodus 25:32-33 says:

> Six branches are to extend from the sides of the lampstand - three on one side and three on the other. Three cups shaped like almond flowers with buds and blossoms are to be on one branch, three on the next branch, and the same for all six branches extending from the lampstand.

The burning bush talking to Moses is said to be an almond tree. The miraculous rod of Aaron, which was stored in the Ark of the Covenant in Tabernacle, was said to blossom flowers of an almond tree. Bitter or sweet almonds were used as omens and signs for Aaron the Patriarch, brother of Moses, when he directed Israelites in the wilderness. Although a nut of an almond tree is a great fit to the FOL symbol and recognized by Orthodox and Catholic iconography in the oval shaped aureole of Saints, there are other plants of even greater interest.

The most famous and the oldest flower decorations are probably similar to lotuses, lilies, crocuses and roses. They can be found from Mesopotamian art since 3500 BC, and they were extensively used in Crete and Egypt around 2000 BC and from that time on. Lilies, although we can’t always be certain of the exact species, are mentioned many times in the Old Testament. Etymology of the lily (the egyptian water lily hrr.t ssn<!-- cite author="Martin Bernal" title=" in "Black Athena: The linguistic evidence" date="" location="Pages 344-346" type="book" href="https://books.google.fi/books?redir_esc=y&hl=fi&id=yFLm_M_OdK4C&q=ssn#v=snippet&q=ssn&f=false" --> being the most central) is a good example of a compound root word spread to different languages and applied to several general and specific flower species, smells, colors, female names, etc. This is very similar to the story of the cane plant.

## Partnership between lilies and pomegranates

What makes a lily interesting is a six-petal appearance of it. In Hebrew language the female name Susanna (Shoshannah), the flower lily (shoshana) and the number six (shesh) are possibly from the same word root. Lily is often presented with another plant dear and meaningful for the people in the Near East and India, i.e. the pomegranate fruit (punica granatum<!-- cite author="wikipedia.org" title="Pomegranate" date="" location="" type="website" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomegranate" -->). The pomegranate, especially in Israel, often has six petals first on a flower development stage and consequently on the other end of the ripe fruit there is a six shaped persistent calyx or crown.

Lilies (as different types of palmettes) and pomegranates are both almost exclusively present on the ancient hybrid Tree of Life illustrations and they are common among buried funerary items. According to the Books of Kings<!-- cite author="" title="Old Testament" date="" location="1 Kings 7:17-19" type="selfref" href="#" -->, capitals of the two pillars that stood in the front of Solomon's Temple in Jerusalem were engraved with pomegranates and lilies. Two pillars in the temple of Solomon made of silver and gold (pillars of cloud and fire) represent similar change of light and darkness. In the book of Judges, the Samson (day) was taken over by Delilah (night, de'lily’h), but after a while, Samson took over Delilah again by breaking apart the two pillars of the temple of the fish-god Dagon<!-- cite author="wikipedia.org" title="Samson" date="" location="" type="website" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samson#Death" -->. Gold bells and pomegranates were attached to the hem of the robe of the jewish High Priest as we can read from the Exodus<!-- cite author="" title="Old Testament" date="" location="Exodus 28:33-34, 39:25" type="selfref" href="#" -->.

There is an evidence that the six-spoked pomegranate was used as a religious symbol in Israel already in the 14-13th century BC. Below is a thumb size object made of ivory representing pomegranate<!-- cite author="wikipedia.org" title="Ivory pomegranate" date="" location="" type="website" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivory_pomegranate" -->. Other picture is a reverse side of a coin issued by the Jewish rebels in 68 AD<!-- cite author="wikipedia.org" title="First Jewish Revolt coinage" date="" location="" type="website" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Jewish_Revolt_coinage" --> which has three pomegranates in the middle of it.

![The pomegranate with six pegs](/media/pomegranatethumb1.png){caption=1}
![Three pomegranates in a coin](/media/israelcoin1.png){caption=1}
<!-- clear -->

This is a good example, how only half of the pegs are shown on each pomegranate, when they are depicted from the side view. But, if you would look them from the top view, in a row the pegs would make 6+6+6. The same applies to a lily symbol according to Dr. Ze'ev Goldmann<!-- cite author="Dr. Ze'ev Goldmann" title="Star of David" date="2008" location="" type="website" href="http://zeevgoldmann.blogspot.fi/2008/08/ii-star-of-david-on-mosaic-floor-at-ein.html" -->:

> The Shoshanim had to be full-size as seen from above, that is six-petalled, as the pillars stood free in front of the Temple, while the capitals of the two engaged pillars in the vestibule had to be tri-petalled, as seen from the side. In its six-petalled form, as well as in the tri-petalled side-view, the Lily came to be the paramount ornament of Jewish art and especially of Jerusalem’s ossuary decoration.

![Fleu-de-lys](/media/fleur-de-lys.png){caption=1 width=100}

Harum-scarum or just provocative, Pope Paul VI (1968-1978) was entitled "Flos Florum" or Flower of Flowers and his coat of arms contained three lilies (see one Fleur-de-lis on the top), again resulting 6+6+6. A small clarification here might be in place. My intention is not to agitate hexakosioihexekontahexaphobia. Through careful analysis religious-mystic history seems to show, that 6, with its multiples, was not considered exclusively evil, bad or unlucky. More or less it should be recognized as a dancing seed in the Yin-Yang symbol, where opposites relatively oscillate and alter their positions constantly.

Below we can see lily flowers from the top and the side view. It further visualizes the idea of 6 being the original 3 plus the mirror of 3 together.

![Lily from the side view](/media/lilyside.png){caption=1}
![Lily from the top view](/media/lilytop.png){caption=1}
<!-- clear -->

The Greek mythology shares the same mysticism for the number six. Hera, the very prominent figure in the ancient Greek art, is said to have held a pomegranate and a lily in her hands. Boeotians called both the lily and the pomegranate with a same name: sida/side<!-- cite author="Krzysztof Tomasz Witczak" title="On The Anatolian Origin Of Ancient Greek σίδη" date="2012" location="Page 115" type="book" href="https://digilib.phil.muni.cz/bitstream/handle/11222.digilib/131952/1_GraecoLatinaBrunensia_19-2014-2_9.pdf" --> giving a name to the famous fermented pear/apple drink later in history. Moreover Persephone<!-- cite author="wikipedia.org" title="Persephone" date="" location="" type="website" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persephone" -->, on her trips between two worlds, finally ate six seeds of the pomegranate (number of seeds vary on some versions of the story). Seasons of the year are said to correlate with her coming and going so that during the autumn/winter (six months) Persephone lives down with Hades and during the spring/summer (six months) she blooms the Earth with Demeter. Cyclical association of the pomegranate is discussed for example by Matt Bennett on his journal article: *The Pomegranate: Marker of Cyclical Time, Seeds of Eternity*<!-- cite author="Matt Bennett" title="The Pomegranate: Marker of Cyclical Time, Seeds of Eternity" date="2011" location="" type="book" href="http://www.ijhssnet.com/journals/Vol_1_No_19_December_2011/7.pdf" -->.

## Life and death drama

These all are examples that witness the widespread mixing of these two plants. They both have something to do with life and death that is: with seasonal change of light and darkness, the Sun (source) and the Moon (reflection). Lily has kept its twofold meaning until our days because it is still the flower of death and the most common fragrance in funerals, after possible aromatic incenses of course. But at the same time a Lily, especially the Madonna lily is a symbol of purity, radiance and innocence, possibly in the way Leonardo wanted to use it on his Annunciation -painting<!-- cite author="wikipedia.org" title="Annunciation (Leonardo)" date="" location="" type="website" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annunciation_(Leonardo)" --> passing by the old tradition of the scenery.

Although lilies and multiple "sixes" are taken as a symbol of death, we can't think of them symbolizing only the sad annihilation side of the fleshy existence of man, but also a moment of rebirth, resurrection and initiation. A willful baptism rite (a ritual bath before service) on a large basin with a brim that was *like the calyx of a lily*<!-- cite author="wikipedia.org" title="Molten Sea" date="" location="" type="website" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molten_Sea" -->, is a transmutation process where a man becomes a fish by diving deep to the ocean of chaos and then comes back to life as a perfected man of cosmos ready to enter the temple. If this happens, and when a human being is fortunate to experience it while alive, he becomes half a fish and half a man, or just a fisherman. If not physical, the effect of death may spiritually have been total and irreversible so that the initiated human being has lost the false sense of self and retained true selfless servantism and altruism, if modern interpretation is allowed here. Few hundreds years before common era we can see this kind of allegorical and ideological thinking getting new heights. In the Christian era it was already common to speak about the second death or spiritual death of an ego<!-- cite author="" title="New Testament" date="" location="Galatians 2:20, Ephesians 4:22-24" type="selfref" href="#" --> meaning that common symbols of actual physical death or afterlife could have been associated with death and rebirth by means of more psychological and spiritual sense.

Symbology is pretty consistent with this big drama scene over the ages and cultures. *Lila* (sanskr.), the play of life is smartly played on the small story of The Fairy Tale of the Green Snake and the Beautiful Lily<!-- cite author="Johann Wolfgang von Goethe" title="The Fairy Tale of the Green Snake and the Beautiful Lily - See more at: http://wn.rsarchive.org/RelAuthors/GoetheJW/GreenSnake.html#sthash.USY93QFo.dpuf" date="1795" location="" type="Novel" href="http://wn.rsarchive.org/RelAuthors/GoetheJW/GreenSnake.html" --> by Goethe. When the fair Lily, accompanied with her ever pleasing harp playing (reminds of Väinämöinen), was on the point of taking leave, the green Snake caught the last lines of the song:

> What can these many signs avail me?<br/>
	My Singer's Death, thy coal black Hand?<br/>
	This Dog of Onyx, that can never fail me?<br/>
	And coming at the Lamp's command?<br/>

> From human joys removed forever,<br/>
	With sorrows compassed round I sit:<br/>
	Is there a Temple at the River?<br/>
	Is there a Bridge? Alas, not yet!

Once the temple is ready and arosen from the river, the snake was praised and ending of the story incorporates the familiar scene of the Hawk and the Sun, or winged sun disk<!-- cite author="wikipedia.org" title="Winged sun" date="" location="" type="website" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winged_sun" --> as it is better known:

> At this instant the Hawk with the mirror soared aloft above the dome; caught the light of the Sun, and reflected it upon the group, which was standing on the Altar. The King, the Queen, and their attendants, in the dusky concave of the Temple, seemed illuminated by a heavenly splendour, and the people fell upon their faces.

## Sweet and salty waters

On Mesopotamian myths special flowers/trees were constantly associated with the water element, underworld streams and lakes from the creation of the world. Underworld sea/god, Apsu<!-- cite author="wikipedia.org" title="Abzu" date="" location="" type="website" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abzu" --> was believed to be a source of all rivers and fresh sweet waters, a nourishing liquid of sacred plants, trees and fruits. Somewhere from the deep waters came up seven wise men<!-- cite author="wikipedia.org" title="Apkallu" date="" location="" type="website" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apkallu" --> who taught knowledge and civilized arts to humankind and then disappeared again. But there was also another kind of sea, salty sea of Tiamat goddess (or Thalassa in Greek), who was the serpent of Chaos, the great Dragon. It is always too daring to talk in the mouth of the ancients, but there may have been people, who understood that these two forces are but two sides of the One force<!-- cite author="" title="Out of the mouth of the most High proceedeth not evil and good?" date="" location="Book of Lamentations 3:38" type="selfref" href="#" --> and mixture of them is the creation of the worlds. Raise of the monotheism on the other hand supports this view of the One principle, but on the other hand monotheism didn't stop people competing and violently promoting the strongest, the highest and the latest ideology of God of their own. Quite opposite. Destroying, refuting and replacing old religions and belief systems with new ones was ongoing process. Interesting is the fact that even appearances and customs of replaced religions were gone, symbology of theirs transformed and continued on new forms.

Once followed the story of the Fleur-de-lis, it becomes apparent that once upon the time the heraldic symbol was associated with six-petalled flowers like a lily and an iris<!-- cite author="" title="Iris has 3 standards upright petals plus 3 falls (hang down). Iris as a rainbow goddess is not without mythical connotations either: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_(mythology)" date="" location="" type="selfref" href="#" -->
. From those flowers lily with pomegranate fruit was in close connection to the Tree of Life and the Menorah. Earlier in history a lily was mixed by etymology and possibly by aromatic usage and cultic means with a blue Egyptian water lily (lotus in further East) which was part of the Tree of Life motif. Smell of the lotus meant a presence of gods and and by the scent of the flower one would be one with the gods.

Roots deep in primordial waters the Tree of Life presented life force and knowledge suck beneath the ground and materialized in the six petal formed plants, lily flower and pomegranate fruit. Kings of nations and Priests of religions were regarded as guardians of the knowledge but real key holders might have been mystic sects who emphasized personal transformation rather than transformation orchestrated by formal constitutions.

I think this is the meaning of the scenery on silver and golden goblets found from Marlik. Base of the goblet with the FOL symbol represents twofold waters, sweet and salty. Monsters getting up from the sea are in the fight, like cosmos and chaos. On the other end we see serpents awakening and on the other end eagles flying free. Goblets that were used on ceremonies were full of meaning. Sip of the drink was for liberation of the earthly worries and troubles. It depended from the subject, if he was about to get in drunk or to realize the meaning of life and death. Mycenaean Golden Rosettes from 1600 BC with the FOL class 1 are special attachments for dead royals. Funerary cosmetic boxes from Thebes having the FOL symbol in the lid may have contained fragrances and perfumes of the flowers we have just talked about. This just adds the holistic appearance of the FOL symbol. It speaks with smells, tastes, for our eyes, ears and every sense.

The Fleur-de-lis / lily / iris can be seen basicly the same symbol with **the Flower of Life and Death**, but former presented from the side view, when latter, the FOL is presented from the top bird view. The FOL pattern as an ornamentation could be called **the Field of Lilies**, or the field of six-petal flowers in more general way. It is just a matter of the view of point to see it, very first things geometrical introspections wishes to teach us.
