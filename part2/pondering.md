# Part 2: Meaning of the symbol

Since my research in autumn 2014, a lot has happened. In the summer of 2015, I made another research trip to Cyprus and Malta. This is because these islands were mentioned on many occasions when I read about the history of the neolithic cultures and their use of geometrical art and symbols. Although not as numerous as in the previous research document, the new items discovered on the trips are still interesting and valuable for further speculation. Especially the old ivory item found from Cyprus with the FOL class 2 motif on a pitted background gives evidential weight for a wider existence of the symbol in around 1500 BC.

I have prepared a classification system for different variations of the symbol to improve categorization and to better define discussion fields for the topic. Classification is already used in this complimentary document. I have placed all previous items from the original research document under the new classifications in this article to help to see interrelations between them.
