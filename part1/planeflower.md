# From a plane to the Flower of Life

The formation of the FOL is easy. First we have one circle (A) on a plane. Then we interlock another circle (B) with the first one by intersecting both circles through their centers:

![Two center intersecting circles](/media/abvesica.png){caption=1}

This figure is known from Old Babylonian times as an *Ox-eye* (igi.gu<sub>4</sub><!-- cite author="Eleanor Robson" title="Mesopotamian Mathematics 2100 - 1600 BC" date="1999" location="Page 46, Figure 3.7 b" type="book" href="http://www.helsinki.fi/~whiting/coefficients01.pdf" -->) and can be seen as a primary generator of well-defined geometric forms. The lens-like part in the middle is called by various names like Vesica Piscis (bladder of a fish), womb / female vulva, and mandorla (almond) which latter name again brings a botanical connection to the symbology of the formation of the FOL. Symmetrical figures outside of the oval central shape are called lunes<!-- cite author="Weisstein, Eric W." title="MathWorld" date="" location="Lune" type="website" href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Lune.html" --> in geometry and they resemble waning and waxing phases of the Moon.


### Rhombus

Another geometrical figure constructed to the intersection points in the middle is a quadrilateral rhombus, which is shown below:

![Quadrilateral rhombus](/media/abrhombus.png){caption=1}

This shape (or thinner lozenge version) has been used on temple mosaics in the ancient Sumerian city of Uruk IV (3400 – 3100 BC) as already mentioned in my previous research<!-- cite author="Marko Manninen" title="Artifacts of the Flower of Life" date="2015" location="Picture 2.2.2" type="website" href="http://artifacts.flowerofliferesearch.com/floweroflife.html#fig2.2.2" -->. Rhombus (*gan illar*<!-- cite author="Eleanor Robson" title="Mesopotamian Mathematics 2100 - 1600 BC" date="1999" location="Page 46, Figure 3.7 a" type="book" href="http://www.helsinki.fi/~whiting/coefficients01.pdf" -->, a bow as denoted by Old Babylonians) can be seen as two equilateral triangles face to face. We can find this symbol often on mosaics and paintings too. Below is a part of the geometrical work on the walls of the ancient synagogue in Sardis<!-- cite author="wikipedia.org" title="Sardis Synagogue" date="" location="" type="website" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sardis_Synagogue" -->:

![Rhombus geometry on Sardis wall](/media/sardis.jpg){caption=1}

By adding one circle to the intersection point C, a triangular wedge shape becomes even more clear:

![Equilateral triangle](/media/abctrianglesmall.png){caption=1}

2300 years ago this figure was studied by Euclid in his book *Elements Book 1*, Proposition 1<!-- cite author="Euclid" title="Elements, Book I" date="300 BC" location="Proposition 1" type="book" href="http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/elements/bookI/propI1.html" -->. From previous etymological notes we remember, how cuneiform language is written with a reed stylus sharpened to a triangular shape in one end. This is what I meant that the whole cuneiform writing system is in the center of the early formation of the FOL. The curved triangular shape in the middle is called Reuleaux triangle<!-- cite author="wikipedia.org" title="Reuleaux triangle" date="" location="" type="website" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuleaux_triangle" --> which has also been studied by Leonardo da Vinci. What did he not study?!

![A simple triquetra symbol](/media/triquetravesica.png){caption=1}

Another shape popping up from the construction, that is continuously used in religious context in various cultures to symbolize trinity, is an interlaced triquetra<!-- cite author="wikipedia.org" title="Triquetra" date="" location="" type="website" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triquetra" --> or a trefoil knot which is shown above.


### Square root of 3

The further procedure to create the FOL is simply repeating: 1) finding a center for a new circle from the previous circles intersecting points and 2) adding a new circle on it. Let's add a circle (D) to the figure:

![Lens in a lens](/media/abcd.png){caption=1}

We can see two other features appear at this point. A smaller lens or leaf occurs at the center of the Vesica Piscis between points A & B. When multiplied these leaves becomes six petals on the rosette. Another feature is a mathematical relationship between CD / AB which is known to be the square root of 3 ( <img src="/media/math/sqrt3.svg" class="math" /> ) or "a measure of a fish". Origin of the latter term or its possible relation to the allegorical story of 153 fishes<!-- cite author="wikipedia.org" title="153 (number)" date="" location="" type="website" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/153_(number)" --> in the New Testament<!-- cite author="biblehub.com" title="New Testament" date="" location="John 21" type="website" href="http://biblehub.com/interlinear/john/21.htm" --> is faded to the history. But we know that Archimedes used the ratio <img src="/media/math/265153.svg" class="math" /> as a lower limit estimation for the square root of 3. He used this ratio further to estimate the relationship between a circle's diameter and circumference - the so famous pi (<img src="/media/math/pi.svg" class="math" />) - giving it a practical value of <img src="/media/math/227.svg" class="math" /> (or <img src="/media/math/317.svg" class="math" />).

Already from Old Babylonian times, it is known that people tended to give descriptive names for all possible figures. Ideas for names were derived from everyday objects. A good example is a form called Arbelos<!-- cite author="wikipedia.org" title="Arbelos" date="" location="" type="website" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbelos" --> or "Shoemaker's knife" which was studied by Archimedes in 250 BC. This is further understood because ancients before Archimedes didn't have mathematic symbols like we have today. Instead, they used rhetorical algebra<!-- cite author="Davis Donald C. Benson" title="A Smoother Pebble" date="2003" location="Page 112" type="book" href="https://books.google.fi/books?id=nXZJauwH2N0C" --> and everyday words for geometric shapes, which on the other hand often had mystical properties within their belief systems. In ancient scripts, like Hebrew and Greek, where alphabetic numerals were used, every word and sentence effectively had a numeric value too<!-- cite author="Stephen Chrisomalis" title="Numerical Notation" date="2010" location="Page 134-149" type="book" href="https://books.google.fi/books?id=kXZhBAAAQBAJ" -->. This gave a playground for learned men to express ideas on their communication system, which is practically unknown to modern people, but still good to know when trying to get into the mindscape of ancient people.

![Arbelos - Shoemaker's knife © Mosmas](/media/arbelos_shoemakers_knife.jpg){caption=1 width=300}

### Six-petal rosette

The naming of the FOL is speculated later on in the document Part 2, so let us finalize the figure by adding circles E, F, and G:

![Six-petal rosette](/media/abcdefg.png){caption=1}

What is the most apparent new feature in this stage, is a six-pointed figure in the middle of the geometrical construction. In art and archeology, the figure is called the six-petal rosette. We can now see how easy it is to create it, and this explains why it has been so widely used over the millenniums all the way until our days.

I haven't really collected items containing the six-petal rosette simply because they are far too numerous and could fill a whole book. A good source for nearly 300 pictures can be found from the dedicated 6-petal photostream<!-- cite author="flickr.com" title="6-petal (The wheel with six spokes-petals)" date="" location="" type="website" href="https://www.flickr.com/groups/1341262@N25/" --> on flickr.com. Recently, I found this symbol from medieval roof paintings (possibly 1400 AD) in the Porvoo Cathedral<!-- cite author="wikipedia.org" title="Porvoo Cathedral" date="" location="" type="website" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porvoo_Cathedral" -->  combined with flower and spiral motifs, which can be seen below.

![Floral motives in Porvoo Cathedral](/media/porvoocathedral.png){caption=1}

Three more figures worth noting are found when connecting six intersecting points with straight lines. They are the hexagon, the hexagram, and the six-spoked wheel. Figures are shown below respectively:

![Hexagon](/media/hexagon.png){caption=1}

![Hexagram](/media/hexagram.png){caption=1}

![Six-spoked wheel](/media/sixspokedwheel.png){caption=1}

<p style="clear: both;"></p>

The figure in the middle, the hexagram is also known as the Star of David. It is still debated if the hexagram is a later pagan association stigmatized to the Judaism, for example into the flag of Israel. It is argued that more ancient and genuine symbol was a seven-branched candle holder, the Menorah of the Temple. However, it is quite evident that numbers <img src="/media/math/6and7.svg" class="math" /> and symbols like the Star of David and the Menorah were unbreakably tied together. Mixed feelings towards the number six apparently came from early Christian apologists and their apocalyptically oriented facile interpretations of the number <img src="/media/math/666.svg" class="math" />. By geometric relations presented in this document, PIE and Semitic numerals phonetic intimation<!-- cite author="" title="Compare coupling 6 and 7 with other numbers from a site listing numerals 1 to 10 with 5000 different languages: http://www.zompist.com/numbers.htm. One would expect 1-2, 3-4, 5-6, 7-8, 9-10 making assimilated rhyming pairs, but for some reason this formula is broken by bringing 6 & 7 together in PIE-Semitic-African languages. My early hypothesis is that this is a result of the increased awareness of the geometric-mathematical relationship between those numbers in Sumerian-Indus cultures around 4000 - 2000 BC." date="" location="" type="selfref" href="#" -->, astro-mythic association with the Pleiades, and symbolic attachment presented later in the Part 2, it can be shown that there are other more natural explanations over too religious anticipation, which give significance to numbers <img src="/media/math/6.svg" class="math" /> and <img src="/media/math/7.svg" class="math" />, <img src="/media/math/67.svg" class="math" /> or its reciprocal <img src="/media/math/76.svg" class="math" /> ratio.

### Six or seven?

The dominant presence of the six-spoked wheel sign in the Old Indus script from the third millennium BC suggests that the meaning of the six is imprinted deeply into the culture. The world leading specialist and professor emeritus of Indology, Asko Parpola associates the six-spoked wheel with the Sun. 

![Seal of the Indus Valley Civilization © World Imaging](/media/indusseal.png){caption=1 width=300}

A. Parpola also mentions that there is a group of six vertical lines with a fish symbol<!-- cite author="Asko Parpola" title="Hind Leg + Fish: Towards Further Understanding of the Indus Script" date="2009" location="Page 47" type="article" href="http://www.harappa.com/script/script-indus-parpola.pdf" -->, which he associates with the Pleiades star cluster. The Pleiades was known to be close to the Sun at vernal equinoxes in the 3rd millennium BC. Both eastern and western traditions share the same identifiers of the Pleiades. Once the Pleiades (meaning "plenty" or "to sail") was seven sister stars visible for naked eye, but then something happened and one of the stars disappeared. According to the Greek legend, Merope<!-- cite author="" title="One of the seven nymphs / sisters of the Pleiades cluster. Meros (grk.) means "part", ops means "an eye" or "a face". Consequently, nowadays partial blindness is called meropia." date="" location="" type="selfref" href="#" -->, the disappeared star of the Pleiades, was having sexual intercourse with a mortal man and became invisible from shame<!-- cite author="naic.edu" title="Pleiades Mythology" date="" location="" type="website" href="http://www.naic.edu/~gibson/pleiades/pleiades_myth.html" -->. The Pleiades was a crucial sign on the night sky for sailors and a seasonal sign of the spring equinox for farmers at the era of Taurus, the Sacred Bull in 4000 - 1700 BC<!-- cite author="wikipedia.org" title="Sacred bull" date="" location="" type="website" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacred_bull" -->.

It is speculated that there were supernova blasts at the moment of disappearance of the lost Pleiades star which caused huge disasters in the northern hemisphere of the Earth<!-- cite author="James A. Marusek" title="Did a Supernova cause the Collapse of Civilization in India?" date="2005" location="" type="article" href="http://www.breadandbutterscience.com/IndiaCataclysm.pdf" -->. The sudden disappearance of the famous star must then have had an impact to different civilizations. Was it a catalyst for changes in ancient civilizations and did it happen at the time of Taurus is just speculation, but strange coincidence with <img src="/media/math/6and7.svg" class="math" /> relation is perfectly fitting to the geometrical progression and historical evanescence of the FOL. Great flood and collapse of the Babel tower are dated between 3000 - 2000 BC according to Biblical chronology, which suggests that there has been yet another dark age we are not totally aware.

The importance of six and seven was so deeply imprinted in the cultural communication components (remember the division of cubit measurement units to Royal = <img src="/media/math/7.svg" class="math" /> palms and Mundane = <img src="/media/math/6.svg" class="math" /> palms in the Old Kingdom of Egypt or the same with the ancient Israelite long and short cubit) that people already in those times became unconscious of their detailed meaning. The structure of <img src="/media/math/6and7.svg" class="math" /> was an integral part of the communication systems, a tool to be used to understand and control circumstances, but nothing to be comprehended.

One more figure to illustrate the relationship between <img src="/media/math/6and7.svg" class="math" /> is presented below. If we draw a circle with a diameter <img src="/media/math/7.svg" class="math" /> (NQ) then the height of the Vesica Piscis (FG) is <img src="/media/math/about6.svg" class="math" />. Consequently, the area of the brown square using approximated value would be <img src="/media/math/36.svg" class="math" />. Half of the diagonal of the black square (Z<sub>1</sub>P<sub>1</sub>) drawn around the circle is <img src="/media/math/about5.svg" class="math" /> or approximately <img src="/media/math/10.svg" class="math" /> as a full diagonal.

![Six and seven ratio](/media/SixAndSevenRatio.png){caption=1}

Close connection to the number <img src="/media/math/5.svg" class="math" /> or halving factor opposed to the number <img src="/media/math/2.svg" class="math" /> as a doubling factor is seen from the square of the <img src="/media/math/7.svg" class="math" /> which is <img src="/media/math/49.svg" class="math" />, just one short of <img src="/media/math/50.svg" class="math" /> (or <img src="/media/math/2times5.svg" class="math" />). <img src="/media/math/710.svg" class="math" /> in Egyptian fractions is denoted by <img src="/media/math/halffifth.svg" class="math" />.

These whole number values are quite practical and can explain why <img src="/media/math/6and7.svg" class="math" /> had such an enigmatic position in ancient stories. In ancient sexagesimal (base 60) and modern (base 10) number systems numbers divided by <img src="/media/math/7.svg" class="math" /> <img src="/media/math/nnotdivides7.svg" class="math" /> will give recurring decimal expansion, meaning that the outcome of the numbers divided by <img src="/media/math/7.svg" class="math" /> are not easy to handle as others<!-- cite author="Kazuo Muroi" title="The Origin of the Mystical Number Seven in Mesopotamian Culture: Division by Seven in the Sexagesimal Number System" date="2014" location="" type="website" href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1407.6246.pdf" -->. Adding that <img src="/media/math/227.svg" class="math" /> has for long been used for pi approximation, I think there are natural (mathematical and geometrical) reasons why <img src="/media/math/7.svg" class="math" /> has such an important role in myths. It can be seen as an invisible actor behind fundamental arithmetic relationships.

So there are six circles around the First One which is in the middle and is connected to all other circles. This First circle is a reminder of the Primum Movens which is to move to the background very soon leaving people to debate if there ever was such a thing called the First Cause and the Prime Mover. Or maybe there was, but it is not taking any action anymore, maybe it is just passively observing the thrive and the cease of the universe that was once set forth. 

![Six circles](/media/sixcircles.png){caption=1}

From the illustration above, we can notice how the first circle can be taken away from the center of the construction while still keeping the figure complete and full. Although they are often cited, it is good to meditate these words from Genesis 2: 1-3:

> Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all their multitude. And on the seventh day God finished the work that he had done, and he rested on the seventh day from all the work that he had done. So God blessed the seventh day and hallowed it, because on it God rested from all the work that he had done in creation.

Number six seems to be the final complete and steady result at this stage, but we know that it was created by the help of the seventh circle in the middle. Thus, we can say that a total of seven circles are the greater base of the FOL while the first two circles forming the Vesica Piscis are the lesser base of the FOL.

![Flower of Life, class 1](/media/sixmoreintersectingpoints.jpg){caption=1 width=300}

When the center circle is included on the motif, FOL class 1 is formed because six more leaves encircling the six-petal rosette become apparent. On the outer edge of the hand-drawn figure above we can see six more intersecting points that urge us to repeat the procedure over and over again.

![Flower of Life, class 2](/media/secondround.jpg){caption=1 width=300}

On the above, figure we have finished the second round and encircled the motif with 12 leaves. This is the FOL class 2. Both class 1 and class 2 are common on ancient mosaic art, ivory items, and wooden carvings.


### FOL - symbol and pattern

When more circles and rounds are added, different levels of the FOL with certain mathematical properties will appear. I have classified these levels or stages in [Appendix 1](../appendix1.md). There is practically no limit on levels we can go around and create new petals for the flower. Thus, we can think that the FOL is a dynamic, infinite process of thriving, producing, generating and spreading. Flowering so to say. Every level holds seeds for the next generation. Seeds, centers of circles, are on the intersecting points on the outer edge of the formation. Intersecting points are wounds on the perimeter. There is a cut on the ground and a new seed is sown. The death and disappearance of the seed on a planar field enable a new greater manifestation of the FOL.

Below we can see the third round of drawing process of the formation of the FOL:

![Flower of Life, round 3](/media/fulfol.png){caption=1 width=300}

Very subtle but still important aspect must be noticed here. If the FOL pattern is continued further like this without the finishing step described below, we can rather speak of the ornamentation than the symbol itself. If we close the picture by filling 18 outer leaves of the hexagonal shape of the figure and remove the leftover circular arcs, we will end up getting a well defined, clearly elaborated, consciously bordered symbol. This way we can make a distinction between an ornament and a symbol.

But this doesn't mean that an ornament can't act as a symbol, even it itself might be constructed from repeated symbols. One can see this ornamentation defined to a higher category, analogical to a decryptable non-verbal sign of intercultural communication as described by Nadezhda Nikolenko<!-- cite author="Nadezhda Nikolenko" title="Ornament as a Symbol of Intercultural Communication" date="2013" location="Page 452" type="article" href="http://www.idosi.org/mejsr/mejsr17(4)13/7.pdf" -->:

> The nature of any ornament is twofold: being a sign-index, a direction indicator in the intercultural communication process, at the same time it is a symbol. It contains cultural messages of communicating ethnic groups in a compact form.

> ...

> It means that in order to facilitate the understanding of the symbolic structures' meaning, we should find analogues of the element in the culture of the recipient. For example, some symbols of the nomadic ornament may have analogues in the ornamental culture of settled folks (astral, solar and plant symbols). Then, in the case of effective intercultural dialogue and with the direct participation and leadership of the communicator, the recipient may have a possibility to learn to interpret adequately the transmitted ornamental symbols.


### Cow who ate a flower

Knowing the simplicity of the construction of the FOL, it is a little bit struggling to find out that the four-petal lattice, the Cownose pattern (or Apsamikku), outscores the FOL by being a far more common symbol in Sumerian and Indus cultures. The popularity of the Cownose over the FOL is still notable in Greco-Roman mosaics. Cownose seems to be the most analyzed geometric form from the ancient time by modern researchers as well. In books about Old Babylonian mathematics and geometry, authors tend to use most of the effort (Duncan Melville, Eleanor Robson, Tom Zara, Jöran Friberg) to the Apsamikku (we may follow the endless debate over the name) and <img src="/media/math/sqrt2.svg" class="math" /> only casually mentioning the six-petal rosette, Vesica Piscis or <img src="/media/math/sqrt3.svg" class="math" />. For an additional example, R. P. Kulkarni mentions Mackay (1948) demonstrating a 12 division base of the four-petal rosette on the Plate XVIII<!-- cite author="R. P. Kulkarni" title="Geometry known to the people of Indus civilization" date="2013" location="Page 452" type="article" href="http://www.new1.dli.ernet.in/data1/upload/insa/INSA_1/20005af9_117.pdf" --> which dates to 3rd or 2nd millennium Indus culture. The exact dating is hard to deduce from the text. But again, the Cownose gets the full attention.


### Oldest reference of the FOL pattern so far

In his book on pottery styles, Gonzague Quivron presents an interesting collection of the floral motifs developing from the early to mature stages<!-- cite author="Gonzague Quivron" title="The Evolution on the Mature Indus Pottery Style in the Light of the Excavations at Nausharo, Pakistan" date="2000" location="" type="article" href="https://www.academia.edu/12459285/The_Evolution_on_the_Indus_Pottery_Style" --> on the Indus Valley Civilization chronology. In the figure 16.8, **the FOL pattern class p exists already in the Pre-Indus traditions**, before Mature Indus period i.e. before 2500 BC. But then it disappears from the motif samples while Cownose motif (16.9) appears practically on every stage. Below is a partial screenshot of the figure 16<!-- cite author="Gonzague Quivron" title="The Evolution on the Mature Indus Pottery Style in the Light of the Excavations at Nausharo, Pakistan" date="2000" location="Page 181" type="article" href="https://www.academia.edu/12459285/The_Evolution_on_the_Indus_Pottery_Style" -->:

![Flower motives](/media/flowermotives.png){caption=1 width=400}

Although not totally satisfactory because I have not found the actual artifact, nevertheless this is the earliest reference to the FOL pattern I have found after my earlier research in 2014. I expected to find it around 2000 BC from Mesopotamia, but it happens to occur on the ancient Indus ceramic pottery decorative motif from the middle of the third millennium BC. Now it is just a matter of debate between historians and their schools, if we can expect that the FOL ornament was really invented in India, or if it was borrowed from Mesopotamia making dating even earlier than 2500 BC. The next occurrence from India is the Bedse cave arch decoration<!-- cite author="Marko Manninen" title="Artifacts of the Flower of Life" date="2015" location="Figure 6.1.10" type="book" href="http://artifacts.flowerofliferesearch.com/2000-0bc.html#fig6.1.10" --> on the Buddhist temple in Maharashtra, India, 200 BC. 

Over 2000 years gap in recorded FOL findings in India must be partly because artifact samples we get from books and media are provided by individuals and organizations who have paid no attention to the FOL motif. FOL motives are left out from prints, they are just not brought to publicity. Yet, I want to believe. Another primary reason might be that the FOL pattern became part of the esoterizing phenomenon, where certain intellectual structures related to subtle angulation of 60 degrees, confusing <img src="/media/math/6and7.svg" class="math" /> parity, disappearance of the seventh star of the Pleiades,... altogether perished from the radar of public eye. These structures, rather than disappearing totally from the culture or becoming a subject of secretive speculation, became an integral part of cultural communication systems, myths, and tools. They were not an object of investigation, they had become banal, too apparent and close for people to be astonished about anymore.

Another innate reason for Cownose being more common is the straight edge appearance and origin of the symbol. Setting lines on a 90 degrees' angle, crossing them like ╳ is easier to do than the subtler 60-degree angle. We could find out the right angles roughly by our eyes. Right angled forms like swastikas can be traced back to 10,000 BC. For triangular orientation some tools, calculation or practice must be done to have a precise solution. Trisecting an angle is a very famous ancient Greek geometric problem that is impossible to solve by a straightedge and a compass<!-- cite author="wikipedia.org" title="Angle trisection" date="" location="" type="website" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle_trisection" -->. Thus, my theory is that finding a 60-degree angle is a result of further development of the structural understanding of the world, the sign of higher resolution capacity of the human mind. Although, as a geometric construction, a triangle comes first from the movement of the second circle perimeter. The human knowledge and the comprehension evolve later to understand the triangularity.

But now it is time to complete the FOL class 3.


### FOL class 3

In the picture below, leftover and erasable arcs are faded by gray dotted lines leaving 18 outer petals as a limiting border of the hexagonal shape symbol. Black solid lines present the final symbol, the Flower of Life class 3:

![Flower of Life class 3](/media/folclass3pattern.png){caption=1 width=300}

Although sometimes used as an ornament and a pattern (particularly on [class p](../appendix1.md#classp) artifacts), my take is that the FOL also has a symbolic form. This comes apparent by enclosing arcs, which is notable on [class 1](../appendix1.md#class1), [class 2](../appendix1.md#class2) and [class 3](../appendix1.md#class3) illustrations. Often we can see the final symbol placed on a circular object, such as the bottom of goblets, vases, and whorls or encircled with a deliberate border, like on mosaics. In his books<!-- cite author="Drunvalo Melchizedek" title="The Ancient Secret of the Flower of Life" date="1999, 2000" location="" type="book" href="#" -->, Drunvalo Melchizedek pays a great attention to the limiting circle around the symbol. Should it be intact or in contact with the formation is a consideration of its own. Seemingly, it will affect on some mathematical ratios we can get from the FOL. In the picture below the interior bigger circle around the motif is in contact with the six outermost smaller circles. The exterior bigger circle finalizes the symbol as it was described by D. Melchizedek. This concludes the formation of the symbol in Part 1 of this complementary document.
