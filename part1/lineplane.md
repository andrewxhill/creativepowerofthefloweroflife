Chinese "Yin and Yang" -figure (on the left) is a beautiful geometrical symbol which contains the idea of opposite seeds. You can see the white seed on the black background and black seed on the white background in a relationship that enables everlasting change and mutation. Not only two is apparent on a line, two points (A & B) and the relation between them or one segment with two ends are giving three "things" at once. Is this the reason why ancient arithmeticians didn't regard one and two as numbers at all, but rather said that three is the first real number? Subject, object and the relation between them, they all are included simultaneously on the conscious act of the investigator.


### Triangle and square

When the space between two points, A & B is maximized, Prime Mover<!-- cite author="wikipedia.org" title="Unmoved mover" date="" location="" type="website" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmoved_mover" --> needs to find new ways to introspect. Instead of increasing what already is a maximum distance from A by moving forward, or decreasing the distance by moving backward on the line, Prime Mover causes a movement to any other direction C with an angle X. And like a magic, the first and the simplest of two-dimensional shapes between all points (A, B & C) is created, a triangle:

![Triangle - the simplest two-dimensional shape](/media/abctriangle.png){caption=1}

The shape of the triangle<!-- cite author="mathsisfun.com" title="Equilateral, Isosceles and Scalene Triangle or Acute, Right and Obtuse Triangle" date="" location="" type="website" href="https://www.mathsisfun.com/triangle.html" --> can be any of the types related to the side lengths and angles of the triangle, but for simplicity and suitability for our theme, we have presented an equilateral triangle as above. Another common way to describe this dimension is by projecting the line CD parallel to the line AB so that it creates a square:

![Projected square](/media/abcdsquare.png){caption=1}

There are several different shapes that four lines can make<!-- cite author="mathsisfun.com" title="Quadrilaterals" date="" location="" type="website" href="https://www.mathsisfun.com/quadrilaterals.html" -->, but we will focus mostly on a square and a rhombus. 


### Circle

Triangular, quadrilateral or any polygonal shape exists in this two-dimensional world. And so does the shape that is the source of all mysteries, a circle. Consider a line constructed from points A and B. Again, if we take a single direction other than backward or forward, we keep the distance to the stationary point A the same, and we keep moving then a circle will appear:

![Simple circle](/media/abcircle.png){caption=1}

By changing a few factors like adding center points or changing the length of the radius, we can draw different types of circles and ellipses.

We don't really know when people have started to use steady or adjustable drafting compasses to draw perfect circles like this. The certain time period of the Indus civilization, the Mature Harappan civilization (2500 - 1900 BC) contains a lot of historical evidence in pottery paintings that certain instruments were used to draw circles<!-- cite author="Sitabhra Sinha, Nisha Yadav, Mayank N. Vahia" title="'In Square Circle: Geometric Knowledge of the Indus Civilization' on Math Unlimited: Essays in Mathematics" date="2012" location="Chapter 27" type="article" href="http://www.tifr.res.in/~archaeo/papers/Harappan%20Civilisation/Mathematics%20of%20Harappans.pdf" -->. Instead of finding the source for the invention of the compass from rounded pottery and their circle oriented decoration or stone circles from Neolithic times, one could see further to the dawn of agriculture when animals were domesticated. It was usual that goats and similar animals were tethered on a center pole. Now when the goat ate grass and stamped the ground meanwhile, it can be seen how a circular area was formed<!-- cite author="history.stackexchange.com" title="When were domesticated animals tethered on a pole with a rope?" date="" location="" type="website" href="http://history.stackexchange.com/questions/16840/when-were-domesticated-animals-tethered-on-a-pole-with-a-rope" -->. This can be imitated easily on a smaller scale with a center stick, a wire, and a pen. 

Anyway, from the formation of a triangle, square and circle we can see how many new things happened and from what started simple is getting more complex now. Still we should see how everything evolves from a single point, extends to a line and finally to a plane. 


### Angles rising from...

The point actually has this second planar dimension in its very etymological nature. Sharp edges of the triangle, corners of the square and degrees of the circle are turning points on a plane which create angles. As we remember sharp sounding *ak-* and *ok-* PIE syllables from the point etymology, softer *ank-* and *ang-* syllables<!-- cite author="utexas.edu" title="Indo-European Lexicon" date="" location="2. ank-, ang-" type="website" href="http://www.utexas.edu/cola/centers/lrc/ielex/X/P0089.html" --> are often related to corners and angles. Conifer<!-- cite author="etymonline.com" title="Conifer" date="" location="" type="website" href="http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=conifer" --> cones<!-- cite author="wiktionary.org" title="Cone" date="" location="" type="website" href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cone" -->, very ancient and widely used symbol on the Assyrian art, are organs directly pointing to or carrying these angles and sharp edges by botanical etymology.

![A four-winged genie in the Bucket and cone motif. Relief from the north wall of the Palace of king Sargon II at Dur Sharrukin, 713 - 716 BC / Public Domain](/media/genie_dur_sharrukin.jpg){caption=1 width=666}

Angle is a new notable feature on the second dimension that should be carefully contemplated. When two lines intersect with each other they form a certain relationship. Say the line a is a straight line going through points A and B. The line a will act as a reference from now on. The straight line b will go via points A and C. Now both lines will meet on the point A forming an intersection point. The special relationship they make at that point is called a slope or a ratio by the fact that against every three horizontal steps (a run) line a takes, the line b will increase its vertical value by two (a rise).

![Slope as a ratio and logos](/media/3per2slope.png){caption=1}

Thus, the ratio is 3 / 2 or its reciprocal 2 / 3 depending on which is the property on you want to compare, a width to a height or a height to a width. Generalizing this idea Thales, the famous mathematician from Miletus around 600 BC found that he can deductively calculate the long forgotten and impossible to measure the height of the Great Pyramid based on the height of himself and the length of his own shadow at the certain time of a day<!-- cite author="Julia E. Diggins" title="String, Straightedge, and Shadow" date="1965" location="Chapter 8" type="book" href="http://www.anselm.edu/homepage/dbanach/thales.htm" -->. This is the very base of the logic itself because using ratios (that is defining relations) and proportions (which is using analogies), logical reasoning is possible. In fact, logic or Logos as ancient Greeks called it, is an actualized proportion.


### ...deep waters

In mythology, the divine reasoning or just the law is best described with angling (fishing with hooks) and fishing nets. Bigger the fishes are, more cosmic and orderly principles of the creation process they are meant to describe. Half a fish and half a man creatures appear on many ancient cultures. In Mesopotamia and Egypt, Abyss or Ab is the primordial sea (Thalassa<!-- cite author="wikipedia.org" title="Thalassa (mythology)" date="" location="" type="website" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thalassa_(mythology)" --> in Greek mythology), where Dagon<!-- cite author="wikipedia.org" title="Dagon" date="" location="" type="website" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dagon" --> or Aptu<!-- cite author="wikipedia.org" title="Aptu" date="" location="" type="website" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aptu" --> (transformed Isis in Egypt) rose up to teach mankind. Controversial Flower of Life symbols shown on the previous research are found straight from <u>Ab</u>ydos, Egypt. Apsamikku (or ab-za-mi), the other "Flower of Life" symbol discussed later in this paper, may refer to the window and the hole to the deepness of the ocean. Order of points in triangle ABC has a strange correspondence to the name syllable of the deepness ABS/ABZ, which seems to remind us that the alphabetical system has been empowered with the creation principles of the ancient myths.

These are very powerful ideas derived from an angle. But I want to get shortly back to the botanical field. A plain flat and thin surface, or a plane as described in mathematics, has etymological roots on a sacred Western Asian broad-leaved plane-tree, Platanus orientalis<!-- cite author="wikipedia.org" title="Platanus orientalis" date="" location="" type="website" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platanus_orientalis" -->. As Victor Hehn mentions, it was under the plane-tree where Plato seats his teacher Socrates and Phaedrus for a chat<!-- cite author="Victor Hehn" title="Cultivated Plants and Domesticated Animals in Their Migration from Asia to Europe" date="1891" location="Page 217" type="book" href="http://www.survivorlibrary.com/library/cultivated_plants_and_domestic_animals-1891.pdf" -->. Was it fanciful Plato thinking himself covering and soothing his dear protagonist Socrates and interlocutor known from many dialogues, Phaedrus<!-- cite author="Plato" title="Phaedrus" date="360 BC" location="" type="book" href="http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/phaedrus.html" --> in a torrid Mediterranean day? We may not know the reason, but we can be sure that it was an ideal place for a conversation of the mastermind and geometry lover, Plato. In one sense Plato further developed the proportional discovery of Thales. Not only was truth reachable by using an analogy, but actually the world of logic or Logos was the only true world making a sensible world only a reflection or a shadow of the immaterial world.

On this plane, we can finally draw a plan for the central figure in question, the Flower of Life.
