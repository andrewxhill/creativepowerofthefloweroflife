### Acknowlements

I want to express my special thanks and deep gratitude to Minna Haataja for her invaluable time spent with proofreading and editing the book. Countless sentences are now much clearer and easier to understand than they would have been, if they were written solely by my own hands.


### About pictures

I have published all my own photos and illustrations with the Creative Commons license<!-- cite author="wikipedia.org" title="Creative Commons license" date="" location="" type="website" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons_license" -->. I believe that is the best way to keep creative work and research hassle free and to be able to be enjoyed by everyone. The pictures and the figures below that have no copyright notice are my own and they are free to be used with a mention *&copy; Marko Manninen* accompanied by a reference to the original work.

Full page pictures presenting the Flower of Life pattern starting Part 1 (page 9) and the Cownose starting Part 2 (page 38), are my own work. The frontpage picture is from the article *Folkkonsten i Finland* by K. K. Meinander published on a book *Nordisk kultur* page 392 in 1931.
