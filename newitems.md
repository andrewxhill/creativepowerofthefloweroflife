# New items

Next seven new items consist of five rather modern artifacts (1400 - 1900 AD), one group of vessels and terracotta torso from the Cypro-Archaic period (800 - 600 BC) and one special ivory item from the Late Bronze Age (1650 - 1050 BC), all with the FOL symbol attached on them. All items (totally 45) from previous research 2014 and new items presented in this document, are collectively listed on [Appendix 2](appendix2.md).


### Item 1

![Rullstol from Finland © ](/media/rullstol.jpg){caption=1 width=600}

Rullstols with the complete class 3 FOL symbol resides in the National Museum of Finland. Artifact is from Björkö island in Korsholm (fin. Mustasaari) municipality, the Gulf of Bothnia, 1850 AD.  This Rullstol is one of the many similar with the FOL symbols. Veera Vallinheimo notes the FOL symbol in her book *Rukinlapa: käyttöesine ja kihlalahja*<!-- cite author="Veera Vallinheimo" title="Rukinlapa: käyttöesine ja kihlalahja" date="1967" location="" type="book" href="#" --> and calls it rosette net (fin. ruusukeverkko). Rosette naming convention is a little bit confusing because the most obvious flower described with the symbol is six-petalled, which is somewhat far from the rose flower. Petal count of roses vary from 0 to more than 100<!-- cite author="marinrose.org" title="Dozens of wonderful single roses" date="" location="" type="website" href="http://www.marinrose.org/singleroses.html" --> plus shape of the petals in the rose differ from regular oval shape in the FOL. In the archeological terminology a rosette should be understood as a general symmetrical flower-like shape, which may have 2 to n concentric petals.

<!--In hebrew the rose and the lily were called with a same name *shoshana* which also might have-->

Anyway, this one plus next bridal gift items (2a, 2b, 2c) were both for decoratively made and functional at the same time. The FOL symbol in forms of class 1, 2 and 3 was very popular handcraft decoration motif from 1700 to 1900 AD in coastal Finland.

For a geometrical curiosity, straight line (the holder of the ball of wool), in the middle of the object cuts the Rullstol so that upper part of it forms so called Arbelos or the Shoemaker’s knife<!-- cite author="wikipedia.org" title="Arbelos" date="" location="" type="website" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbelos" -->, which was discussed on Part 1.


### Item 2 (a, b, c)

![Distaff comp](/media/distaff-comp.jpg){caption=1}

![Distaff blade 1](/media/distaff-blade-1.jpg){caption=1}

![Distaff blade 2](/media/distaff-blade-2.jpg){caption=1}

Distaff comp and blades made for bridal gift. We can see Flower of Life motif in all classes from 1 to 3 plus six petal rosettes on pictures. Motif is said to come from Western Europe via Sweden and Russia to the coastal Finland. Several similar items with FOL creatively carved on them are found from the period of 1600 - 1900 AD.

Since crafting blades (fin. rukinlapa) became very famous art for common people later on, these objects with various rounded circular motives can be found around the country from several museums and even outdoor summer markets. I wouldn't be surprised if FOL symbol with some of its variation is found from the soundhole of the Kantele instrument as it is seen in class 1 form on Polish fiddle, Suka<!-- cite author="wikipedia.org" title="Suka biłgorajska" date="" location="" type="website" href="https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suka_bi%C5%82gorajska" -->.

Clearly main mental images attached to them are: feminine, beauty, celebration, weaving, symmetry, roundness and circularity. Although making an impression in mundane artistic way is more apparent than any other deeper spiritual meaning at least in the modern version of objects, it would be interesting to trace source of the idea of the FOL further to Russia and Western Europe, why not via Sweden also.


### Item 3

![Wall drawing on Rožmberk castle © Mark Libal](/media/rozmberk-castle-wall.jpg){caption=1 width=600}

The Flower of Life class 2 symbol without surrounding petals and other geometric symbols are visible in the castle of Rožmberk<!-- cite author="wikipedia.org" title="Rožmberk Castle" date="" location="" type="website" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ro%C5%BEmberk_Castle" --> in the Czech Republic. On 14 - 16th century AD castle was owned by a Czech alchemist, symbols originating probably from that period.

### Item 4

![Cupola of the church of St. Paul in Egypt © Tatiana Kiseleva](/media/coptic-church-cupola.jpg){caption=1 width=600}

The carousel of the saints riding on the cupola of the underground church of St. Paul<!-- cite author="wikipedia.org" title="Paul of Thebes" date="" location="" type="website" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_of_Thebes" --> in Thebes, Egypt. Among the Saints are fourth-century Roman Christian soldiers, Sergius and Bacchus<!-- cite author="wikipedia.org" title="Sergius and Bacchus" date="" location="" type="website" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergius_and_Bacchus" -->. In the center the FOL class 2. Paintings were produced by the monastery monks in 1713, and paintings are probably overlay of earlier iconography that is lost to us. The church is one of the four churches in the Coptic monastery of St. Paul in the eastern desert of Egypt<!-- cite author="wikipedia.org" title="Monastery of Saint Paul the Anchorite" date="" location="" type="website" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monastery_of_Saint_Paul_the_Anchorite" --><!-- cite author="touregypt.net" title="The Monastery of St. Paul In Egypt's Eastern Desert" date="" location="" type="website" href="http://www.touregypt.net/featurestories/stpaul.htm" --><!-- cite author="claremont.edu" title="Dayr Anba Bula - Claremont Coptic Encyclopedia" date="" location="" type="website" href="http://ccdl.libraries.claremont.edu/cdm/ref/collection/cce/id/2128" -->.


### Item 5

![Painted pottery from Cyprus](/media/painted-pottery.jpg){caption=1 width=600}

Pottery found from the Archaeological museum of Nicosia<!-- cite author="gov.cy" title="Cyprus Museum, Lefkosia" date="" location="" type="website" href="http://www.mcw.gov.cy/mcw/DA/DA.nsf/0/67084F17382CF201C2257199001FE4AD?OpenDocument" -->, Cyprus. In addition to this, other vessel and the terracotta torso from the same museum had the Flower of Life decoration belt similar to this. Flower motives on the vessel and fishes may very well have been consciously selected by the painter. They can be classified as the FOL class p, because motif is used as a band pattern rather than a symbol. Object dates to Cypro-Archaic 1 Period i.e. 750 - 600 BC.

Pattern seems to be drawn by free hand, probably directly from a model, until painter has been very skilled and experienced with painting. As a freehand looking style this resembles the oldest pattern (2000 years older than this vase) found as a reference from the book *The Evolution on the Mature Indus Pottery Style in the Light of the Excavations at Nausharo* by Gonzague Quivron<!-- cite author="Gonzague Quivron" title="The Evolution on the Mature Indus Pottery Style in the Light of the Excavations at Nausharo, Pakistan" date="2000" location="" type="article" href="https://www.academia.edu/12459285/The_Evolution_on_the_Indus_Pottery_Style" -->. Painting on a curved surface is a more difficult to reach exactness of the pattern than we can see on flat surfaces.


### Item 6

![Ivory spindle whorl from Cyprus](/media/ivory-whorl.jpg){caption=1 width=600}

Ivory item, probably a spindle whorl or a disc served as a lid, containing Flower of Life motif class 2. It is found and categorized as a local object in the sanctuary of Aphrodite, visible in the museum of Palaipafos, Kouklia, Cyprus.

Dating is mentioned between 1600 - 1100 BC making it one of the oldest FOL found from the mediterranean world. Similar artifact was already found on the previous research from the British museum adding evidence of the symbol being known possibly to the Mycenaean traders in the famous trade island at that time. 

Other remarkable detail is the pointillism used on the surface of the flat ivory object. Pointillism seems to have unresearched origin in the past. On the left is an example of small drilled holes on the Neolithic temples in Malta from the 3rd millennium BC. Pitted decoration is mostly toward sun so that when sun rays are shining from the morning until evening they hit stone face, which are pitted with small holes. Other side of the stones are blank so there must have been a certain reason pitted sides are toward the Sun. Association to honey bee cells and some sea shells is easy to make from the pitted decoration on many cases. FOL artifacts with a pitted background decoration are visible on items: 3, 5, 14, 27. Items 1 and 4 has a round dint between triangular holes surrounded by leaves. Because mosaics are made of small pebbles they may look like giving a similar effect of dotted background, but that is hardly deliberate. It is yet to be seen if the FOL origin can ever reach to the neolithic period on the fourth millennium BC, not likely, but obsession to a dotted motif may have something to do with each other.


### Item 7

![Woodcarwings from Poland © Tatra Museum](/media/kwiat-zycia-zakopane-1.png){caption=1 width=600}

This kind of ornaments are very common in Zakopane town, Poland. The Flower of Life is called *Kwiat Życia* in Polish. You can find more similar photos from my Pinterest collection<!-- cite author="Marko Manninen" title="Flower of Life Pinterest board" date="" location="" type="website" href="http://pinterest.com/markomanninen/flower-of-life-history/" -->. The photo presented above is from the Tatra Museum in Zakopane collection and used with permission<!-- cite author="muzeumtatrzanskie.pl" title="Muzeum Tatrzanskie - Willa Oksza" date="" location="" type="website" href="http://www.muzeumtatrzanskie.pl/?strona%2Cdoc%2Cpol%2Cglowna%2C1376%2C0%2C842%2C1%2C1376%2Cant.html" -->.

The FOL ornament and symbol has been used widely on woodcarwings around the Europe and Mediterranean world in 1600 - 1900 AD. It was a common practice for carpenters to decorate ready-made buildings with circular symbols. It is possible that the FOL eventually become a sign of woodworking guilds at that era. Take a look at the wood pole below for example:

![Wooden pole from Cyprus](/media/wooden-pole.png){caption=1 width=600}

Hexagonal ornament and carvings on the wooden pole was brought from the mountains to the medieval museum of Lemessos (Limassol), Cyprus when the original 1600 AD orthtodox church roof was replaced by a new one. Underside of the pole, althought too dim to clearly see, is also the FOL class 2 symbol.
