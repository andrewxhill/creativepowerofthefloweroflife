Introduction
============

This is my second book intended to discover the history of the Flower of Life symbol. Now my main focus is on the interpretation of the symbol and meanings attached to it through the history, starting from the bronze age until our days.

The reader is expected to be familiar with basics of the Flower of Life geometry<!-- cite author="wikipedia.org" title="Flower of Life geometry" date="" location="" type="website" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flower_of_Life_(geometry)" -->. Elementary knowledge of the ancient Near East history and history of mathematics is helpful. Knowledge of visual arts, geometry, and comparative religion studies are also useful.

I hope my independent research provides valuable resources for people to do further investigation with the topic.
